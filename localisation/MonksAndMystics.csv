EVTDESC_MNM_6250_A;I have pondered my mission to train an apprentice in the shadowy arts of assassination and I'm considering my own [assassin_protege_1.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHeCap] has been illustrating a steely determination in some matters, and I think [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHe]'s more clever than [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHe] lets on... It could be a dangerous path, but under my wing, perhaps [assassin_protege_1.GetSheHe] could excel?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6250_B;A youngster has been caught red-handed trying to pickpocket me today. My guards are furious with the child, but noting the quiet defiance in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] eyes, I am reminded of myself. Remembering the mission assigned to me by the Assassins, I wonder if the child is as sly as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] seems – perhaps this incident could benefit us all?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6250;I'll speak with [assassin_protege_1.GetTitledFirstName] about [assassin_protege_1.GetHerHis] potential.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege_1.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6250;Maybe [assassin_protege_2.GetTitledFirstName] would be better suited for this...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege_2.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_6250;Actually, [assassin_protege_3.GetTitledFirstName] is the best choice.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege_3.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTD_MNM_6250;Let [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] go! I have a special interest in this lost soul.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTD_MNM_6250_TT;You begin training §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTE_MNM_6250;Take the urchin away – one does not simply steal from the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTE_MNM_6250_TT;You ignore the opportunity to train an apprentice for §Ythe Assassins§!. The child is imprisoned for [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] crimes.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTF_MNM_6250;I can't be bothered with this right now.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6252;Bolstered by my tutelage [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] is growing into a confident young [assassin_protege.GetBoyGirl]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] reads everything I throw at [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] and [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] seems eager to learn more about our beliefs... The next step for [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] should be chosen carefully.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6252;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] should focus on cultural adaption, for infiltration missions.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6252_TT;You will encourage the scheming skills of §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6252;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] could probably use more practice with the dagger.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6252_TT;You will encourage the martial skills of §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_6252;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] needs to know balance in all [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] areas of expertise.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_6252_TT;You will strive for a well-balanced training for §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_A;The rigorous training I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to subtly befriending several foreign diplomats at court, [assassin_protege.GetTitledName] has been studying the books fervently, even in candlelit hours. I believe it is time for a test of some sort.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_B;The combat training I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to having spent rigorous amounts of time in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] practice grounds, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] clearly outmatches any opponents [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] own age. I believe a test is in order.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6253_C;The rigorous schedule I set up for [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] continues to yield promising results – in addition to demonstrating a knack for foreign languages, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] is proving increasingly proficient in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] combat training. I believe it is time for a test of some sort.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6253;I'll have my associates arrange some sort of test.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6253_TT;This outcome will be influenced by the various skills of §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_A;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] midnight when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]. The reports state that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] somehow managed to talk [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] way out of it, convincing the attackers that they had the wrong target. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] then sent them on a wild goose-chase around the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], which I am told lasted hours.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_B;[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] expertly handled the surprise attack I planned out, striking the thugs down with frightening precision. When I explained that the men [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] had beaten, one even killed, had been working on my orders, [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] cocked an eyebrow at me before leaning back in [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] chair, smiling.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6254_C;The hired thugs I sent to ambush [assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName] came back bruised and confused tonight. When I confront my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] calmly explains that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] made them see the error of their ways. "One will likely die from the injury", I say. [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] nods slowly, before returning to [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] book.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6254;You handled this well, [assassin_protege.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6254_TT;The Assassins will be pleased to hear of your protege, §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_A;[assassin_protege.GetFirstName] noticed the thugs coming and managed to sneak into a building to hide. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] caused quite a ruckus as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] stumbled into the bedroom of a local merchant and his wife. The escape from there was hasty, but I suppose I'm not entirely disappointed in [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] surviving the ambush.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_B;[assassin_protege.GetFirstName] noticed the thugs coming and eagerly drew [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] blade on them. The fight that ensued left both parties wounded, but at least [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] survived the ambush. I'll have to talk to [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] about the optimal points of attack on the human body, however.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6255_C;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] midnight when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] attempted to fool them by claiming my orders had changed, that the ambush was called off. While I am impressed that [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] saw through the test, [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] did not sell it completely, and instead ended up with running away in panic.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6255;[assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap]'s good, but [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] still has a lot to learn.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6255_TT;You believe in [assassin_protege.GetHerHim]. The Assassins will be informed of your apprentice, §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6256;It was a [Root.GetWeatherAdjective] night when the hired thugs descended upon [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. [assassin_protege.GetSheHeCap] apparently tried to talk [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] way out of the situation, but the attackers were not so easily charmed... They were not supposed to injure [assassin_protege.GetHerHim] badly, but something must have gone wrong.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6256;Oh, poor [assassin_protege.GetFirstName]. I thought you had potential.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6256_TT;The life of an Assassin is not an easy one but it would seem §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§! was not ready for it. The Assassins will be informed of your failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6256;This hurts more than I thought it would.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6256_TT;The life of an Assassin is not an easy one but it would seem §Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§! was not ready for it.\nThe Assassins will be informed of your loss.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6258;The time has come for me to confess my love for the one true god.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6258;I'll scream it from the top of my lungs!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6258;I'll join the religion in secret.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_A;Over the past few months, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has deeply impressed both me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that I should be proud to have been the guardian of this faithful young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_B;In spite of [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] injuries, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has proven [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself], both to me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that they are pleased with my training of the faithful young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_C;The death of my dear apprentice took me by surprise, but what is worse is the complete silence I have been met with from the Assassins. I can only assume that they are disappointed – all I can do is wait for a new mission.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_D;Over the past few months, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has impressed both me and my order. The Assassins have informed me that as soon as [assassin_protege.GetSheHe] has agreed to convert to our faith, they will share in my pride as guardians of this remarkable young [assassin_protege.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6259_E;In spite of [assassin_protege.GetHerHis] injuries, my apprentice [assassin_protege.GetFirstName] has proven [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself], both to me and my order.

EVTDESC_MNM_6259_F;The death of my dear apprentice took me by surprise, but what is worse is the complete silence I have been met with from the Assassins. I can only assume that they are disappointed – all I can do is wait for a new mission.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6259;Allah is with us.;;;;;;;;;;X

6252_CONVERT_APPRENTICE_TT;§Y[assassin_protege.GetTitledFirstName]§! will offer [assassin_protege.GetHerselfHimself] up to Allah and convert to the religion of Shia Islam.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6260_A;My child, and apprentice in the shadowy arts of assassination, has been the victim of an unexpected turn of events and a most untimely death. I could be beside myself with pain, but I must focus on recovering from the loss, while the Assassins are informed of my predicament.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6260_B;My apprentice in the shadowy arts of assassination has been the victim of an unexpected turn of events and a most untimely death. The Assassins will be informed of my loss and predicament.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6260;This is highly unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6260_TT;You fail your mission to train an apprentice.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7001_A;I'm having dinner and plenty of drinks with [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledName] tonight. It's lovely, yet what I am most charmed by is [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] [satanists_recruiter.GetHerselfHimself]. Why else would I not immediately stop our conversation, which has slowly begun to touch upon some almost heretical ideas, questioning the salvation of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7001;If we do not ask questions, why did [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] make us curious?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7001_TT;You think it's a great discussion, fueled by alcohol or not.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7001;We should not speak of this, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7001_TT;You would never question the authority of the almighty.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7002_A;Meeting with [satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName], I made sure to only cautiously question the absolute power of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] almighty [satanists_recruit.Religion.GetHighGodName]... Thankfully, it seems that my carefully chosen words had the desired effect on [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim]. From [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] glittering eyes I got the distinct impression that [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] enjoyed the philosophical aspect of our conversion.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7002_B;Meeting with [satanists_recruit.GetTitledFirstName], I made sure to only cautiously question the absolute power of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] almighty [satanists_recruit.Religion.GetHighGodName]... Regretfully, it seems that my words only irritated my [satanists_recruit.GetRootRelation] – from the steely look [satanists_recruit.GetSheHe] finally gave me, I should probably steer clear of [satanists_recruit.GetHerHim] for now.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7002;A sensible [satanists_recruit.GetManWoman], [satanists_recruit.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7002_TT;Continue your endeavor to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7002;I'm not sure [satanists_recruit.GetHerHis] sentiments were sincere...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7002_TT;You end your endeavor to recruit §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_7002;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7003_A;Walking the palisades of my [Root.GetCapitalHolding] I am joined by [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]. I find myself agreeing with a lot of the concepts [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] presents – the futility of prayer particularly resonates with me. Suddenly, [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] turns to me and presses a small leather pouch into my hand. "My [Root.GetLordLady], will you carry this with you, for protection?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7003;I'll keep it hidden, and I thank you, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7003_TT;You encourage the advances made by §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7003;What is this? I should call you a [satanists_recruiter.GetDWMagician]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7003_TT;You distance yourself from §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7004_A;I've arranged a run-in with [From.GetTitledFirstName] on the palisades of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetCapitalHolding] today. [From.GetHerHisCap] face lights up upon seeing me and we stay out talking for hours. I offer [From.GetHerHim] a protection spell, in a leather pouch – of course, I do not explain the content... Yet [From.GetSheHe] smiles, accepting the token.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7004_B;I've arranged a run-in with [From.GetTitledFirstName] on the palisades of [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetCapitalHolding] today. [From.GetHerHisCap] face darkens when I again attempt to discuss my world views. I then offer [From.GetHerHim] my favorite protection spell, a chicken leg in a leather pouch – I thought it was harmless enough, but [From.GetSheHe] refuses to accept the gift.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7004;[From.GetSheHeCap] just needs one more little push.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7004_TT;Invite §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7004;It's been interesting, but I don't think [From.GetSheHe] is ready for more.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_7004;This has been a wasted effort – [From.GetFirstName] is locked in [From.GetHerHis] views.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7005;"What if I told you that all you have been taught to believe in is a lie?" [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] continues, throwing a cautious glance around us before pulling up [satanists_recruiter.GetHerHis] sleeve, revealing a scar in the shape of a pentagram. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] lied to Adam in the Garden of Eden. Reject the Tyrant deity and let [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] guide your steps...";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7005;You truly are a [satanists_recruiter.GetDWMagician] then? Can you [Root.GetDWReasonToJoin]?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7005_TT;You ask §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! how you can begin your journey into this forbidden knowledge.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7005;That is blasphemy, [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName]! Leave my sight, before I call the guards!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7005_TT;You dismiss §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! offer and pretend it never happened.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7006;When I revealed the brand on my lower arm, expecting the final hook to sink in, [From.GetFirstName] staggered backwards in shock and made a hand gesture for protection. "That is blasphemy, [Root.GetFirstName]" [From.GetSheHe] said, eyes wide. "Leave my sight, before I call the guards!" [From.GetSheHe] called and it was with reluctance, albeit hastily, that I left.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7006;If I can't turn [From.GetHerHim], no one can.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7007;When I proceeded to reveal the brand on my lower arm, certain that the final hook would sink in, [From.GetFirstName] inhaled sharply, worrying me for a second. "You truly are a [Root.GetDWMagician] then", [From.GetSheHe] says, eager and relieved. "Can you help me [From.GetDWReasonToJoin]?" [From.GetSheHe] continues, eyes pleading.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7007;Patience, [From.GetSisterBrother]. We will speak more soon.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7007_TT;Write a letter to the coven about §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! induction. [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] §Y[satanists_inductor.GetFirstName]§! will handle it from here.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7008;"We might... If you offer yourself up to [satanists_recruiter.GetDWDevil], he will grant you powers [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has kept from us humans." Fingering the leather pouch in my pocket, I slowly nod. "Oh, and I think you'll enjoy it..." [satanists_recruiter.GetSheHe] said, with a knowing smile.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7008;If there is any chance it'll [Root.GetDWReasonToJoin], I will.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7008_TT;§Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! leaves you alone for now – the coven will be in contact with you.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7009_A;It has been some time since [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] was in contact with me. I have been mulling over [satanists_recruiter.GetPossPronoun] words. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] told Adam he would die if he ate of the forbidden fruit... [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] lied. The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s in the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] lie.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7009_ALT;It has been some time since [satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] was in contact with me. I have been pondering what [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] would think of me for venturing down this path, but [satanists_recruiter.GetFirstName] has already offered me more support than [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] ever has. I have begun studying books on the occult and so far I'm finding the views preached at the [Root.GetHouseOfWorship] to be narrow-minded, at best.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7009;Their lies are meant to hold us back!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7009_TT;You continue to await further instruction.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7009;I can't believe I have been so gullible.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_7009;I am beginning to feel that I have been missing out...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTD_7009;Why must we always put the needs of others before our own...?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7010_A;I found some cryptic scrawlings written in blood on my bedroom door this morning. The guards say they haven't seen anyone enter during the night and I dare not ask my [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] to decipher it. Yet, I think I understand... The pentagram... the mark of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7010;Of course, the bargain must be struck!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7010_TT_1;You carve a pentagram into your arm, just like the one §Y[satanists_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName]§! showed you.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7010_TT_2;You cut your into your arm, a star surrounded by a circle, a symbol from your forbidden studies.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7010;My immortal soul... What if I'm wrong?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_7010_TT;You order your servants to scrub the door clean, putting to rest any rumors this could stir up.\n;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTA_7014_TT;You will be on the look-out for "the messenger".\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7015;I've met an intriguing and hypnotically beautiful [From.GetManWoman] at court. Apparently, this [From.GetFirstName] is a foreign diplomat? I engaged [From.GetHerHim] in conversation for the first time today, and we spoke at length about [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural]. I was shocked when [From.GetSheHe] carefully pulled up [From.GetHerHis] sleeve, revealing the mark of Lucifer.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTA_7015;You're the messenger?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7016;The [satanists_inductor.GetSocietyRank] smiles. "I'm pleased to find you not only a charming [Root.GetManWoman], [Root.GetFirstName], but also one capable of intellectual discourse. The brethren value the pursuit of knowledge, you see, in addition to more... earthly pursuits." [From.GetHerHisCap] smile turns into a predatory grin as [From.GetSheHe] continues: "We'll soon see exactly how committed you are...";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7016;I... What do you need me to do?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7016_TT;§Y[satanists_inductor.GetTitledFirstName]§! offers no reply, instead taking you by the hand.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7017_A;[satanists_inductor.GetFirstName] escorts me to my bedchamber. I hesitate upon entering, finding it flooded with light, as candles form a circle around my bed. Several hooded figures surround the room, chanting in unison. "Fear not, [Root.GetSisterBrother]. Power and pleasure – these are the gifts of [satanists_inductor.GetDWDevil].";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_7017;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6022_A;Since I had such a good time a few weeks back, I invited [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] to share an informal meal. Yet again the conversation found its way to the topic of religion and righteousness. [assassins_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] expressed [assassins_recruiter.GetHerHis] admiration for those willing to give their life fighting for their beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6022_B;Most guests have departed and evening has turned into early morning, yet [assassins_recruiter.GetTitledFirstName] and I are still deep in conversation. We are talking about religion, righteousness, how to do the right thing. [assassins_recruiter.GetSheHeCap] expresses [assassins_recruiter.GetHerHis] admiration for those willing to give their life fighting for their beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6022;I agree, [assassins_recruiter.GetFirstName]. If only I could be more like them.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6023_A;I was just about to draft an invitation when [From.GetTitledFirstName] invited me to dine with [From.GetHerHim]. We talked for many hours, even as the plates were emptied and the cups drained. As I praised those willing to die for their faith, [From.GetFirstName] agreed wholeheartedly, wishing [From.GetSheHe] could be more like them.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6023_B;I was just about to draft an invitation when [From.GetTitledFirstName] invited you to dine with [From.GetHerHim]. The conversation flowed easily and [From.GetFirstName] expressed many admirable sentiments. However, when I mentioned those willing to die for their beliefs, [From.GetSheHe] sneered and condemned "such fanatics".;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6023;I think the time has come to ask the question.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6023_TOOLTIP;Invite §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! to join the Assassins.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6023;Although I fear [From.GetFirstName] is unwilling to fight, [From.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_6023;"Fanatics"? [From.GetFirstName] is blind to the righteousness of our ways!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6024;We are quiet for a moment, both seemingly contemplating these devoted souls. Then [From.GetFirstName] looks up at me, a curious intensity in [From.GetHerHis] gaze. "That is not an impossible wish, [Root.GetFirstName]. Are you ready to kill and, if He wills it, get killed to defend the words of His Prophet and the rightful heir?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6024;I am, [From.GetFirstName]. And you say there is a way?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6024_TOOLTIP;Ask §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! what you can do to serve a greater cause.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6024;What nonsense are you speaking, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6024_TOOLTIP;Dismiss §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! question and end the dinner.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6025;When I suggested there is a way for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to serve the greater good, [From.GetSheHe] only scoffed dismissively and changed the subject. Judging by the look [From.GetSheHe] gave me as I left, however, it seems as if [From.GetFirstName] is not so oblivious after all...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6025;[From.GetSheHeCap] is all grand words but lacks true courage. Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6026;When I suggested there is a way for [From.GetTitledFirstName] to serve the greater good, [From.GetHerHis] eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope. "I am ready, [Root.GetFirstName]. Please, if it is true, will you set me on this path?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6026;Someone will get in touch with you shortly, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6026_TOOLTIP;Write a letter to the order about §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! induction. [assassins_inductor.GetSocietyRank] §Y[assassins_inductor.GetFirstName]§! will handle it from here.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6027;"I do, [Root.GetFirstName]," says [From.GetTitledFirstName] with a solemn, almost ceremonial, voice. "There is an Order devoted to Allah and the rightful Caliph. One that defends those true of faith and bring vengeance to their persecutors. The Assassins are always in need of champions. Think it over, and someone might reach out...";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6027;Me, an Assassin? Perhaps this is my destiny...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6027_TOOLTIP;Think things over while you wait for someone to get in touch.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6028;My eyes open, seeing only darkness. For a moment, my mind is blank, before the first thoughts get through the haze of sleep. Why did I wake up? A deep [Root.GetManWoman]'s voice cuts through the silence, startling me. "The time has come for you to profess your devoutness to Allah and the rightful imam Ali.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6028;Allahu akbar! Glory to Ali!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6028_TOOLTIP;Declare your devoutness to Allah and Ali.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTD_6028;I... I'm not sure I have what it takes.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTD_6028_TOOLTIP;Do not declare your devoutness.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6029;"Excellent." I turn my head towards the voice. A hooded figure steps out of the shadows by the [Root.GetChamberOpening] and a hand appears from underneath the cloak, holding out a piece of parchment. "Before we continue, you must sign this. A written pledge of allegiance to the Grand Master of the Assassins. A routine... safety measure.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6029;Of course. One moment, let me find a quill...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6029_TOOLTIP;Sign the pledge of allegiance.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6029;But this could be used against me!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6029_TOOLTIP;Refuse to sign the pledge of allegiance.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6030;As soon as I lift the tip of the quill from the parchment the hooded [Root.GetManWoman] snatches it from the desk. "The Grand Master will be pleased, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. You will receive an invitation to our stronghold, but for now, go back to bed. You will need the rest." The next moment, [Root.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6030;Farewell... I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6030_TOOLTIP;Now all you can do is wait.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6033;As-salaam alaykum, [Root.GetTitledFirstName]\nYou are hereby invited to the Assassins stronghold in [inductor_rendezvous.County.GetName]. Arrive at the [inductor_rendezvous.GetHolding] of [inductor_rendezvous.GetName] in a fortnight's time. One of our people will collect you there. Until then, keep safe, and breath not a word of this meeting to any living soul.\n\nPraise be to Allah!\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6033;I shall be there.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6033_TOOLTIP;Prepare for your journey to §Y[inductor_rendezvous.GetName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6034;The journey to [inductor_rendezvous.GetName] was comfortable, however, the dwindling mountain path to the Assassins' stronghold was a torment to tread. As I finally arrive at the castle, my guide brings me to the main tower, where I am introduced to [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6034;I am ready to serve, [From.GetSocietyRank].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6035;There is no time for pleasantries, not even a moment to catch my breath, before [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] leads me through another door, down a spiraling stone staircase. We descend in silence. The stair ends and the [From.GetSocietyRank] opens another door, revealing a gloomy basement room and a figure kneeling on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6035;Who... who is that?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6036_A;"This," [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] says solemnly as I enter, "is your test". With these words, [From.GetSheHe] pulls the hood from the [assassins_sacrifice.GetManWoman]'s head. It is [assassins_sacrifice.GetTitledFirstName], my [assassins_sacrifice.GetRootRelation]! The shock in [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHis] eyes must be mirroring my own. "This [assassins_sacrifice.GetManWoman] is an enemy of our faith. End [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHim]." The [From.GetSocietyRank] offers me a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6036_B;"This," [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] says solemnly as I enter, "is your test". With these words, [From.GetSheHe] pulls the hood from the [Root.GetManWoman]'s head. It is one of my servants! The chock in [Root.GetHerHis] eyes must be mirroring my own. "This [Root.GetManWoman] is an enemy of our faith. End [Root.GetHerHim]." The [From.GetSocietyRank] offers me a dagger.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6036;If it is the Grand Master's wish.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6036_TOOLTIP;You kill the servant.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6036;I... I can't do this!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6036_TOOLTIP;You refuse and try to escape.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_6036;I beg of you, let us go. I can pay you, I swear.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_6036_TOOLTIP;Attempt to bribe §Y[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]§! into letting you and your intended victim go.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6037;The blood is still gushing from the infidel's limp body as I kneel in front of the [From.GetSocietyRank]. [From.GetSheHeCap] recites the oath of the Assassins and I repeat after [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] speaks the final words, inducting me into the order, [From.GetSheHe] smears the blood across my cheeks. "Stand up, Adherent [Root.GetFirstName]. Welcome to the Assassins.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6037;My life for Allah! Praised be the Assassins!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_A;There is no time to think. As I accept the dagger from [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] I sink it into [From.GetHerHis] stomach. I free my intended victim and drag [assassins_sacrifice.GetHerHim] after me, up the stairs, without looking back once. You just keep running. By some miracle, no one intervenes.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6038;We might be safe for now, but for how long?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6038_TOOLTIP;You manage to escape from the assassins.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_B;I turn around and run. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s footsteps get closer behind me and as I reach the top of the stairs, [From.GetSheHe] grips a fistful of my mantle, pulling you down on top of [From.GetHerHis]. Vertigo. Crippling pain. Blind, manic frenzy. By some miracle, you manage to free yourself. You are alive. But for how much longer?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_6038;They are... they are coming for me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_C;There is no time to think. As I accept the dagger from [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] I stab at [From.GetHerHim], without a moment's hesitation. The blade strikes only air. [From.GetSheHeCap] moves too quickly. I am on the floor, trapped under the weight of [From.GetHerHis] body. I plead for my life as [From.GetSheHe] wrestles the weapon from my hand.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_6038;I... I panicked! Please! You... you have to believe me!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6038_D;The look on [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s face is pure disappointment. "We had high hopes for you, [Root.GetFirstName], although it seems we were mistaken." I swallow. Loudly. "This cowardice makes you useless to us. Your gold, on the other hand..." As I leave, my intended victim in tow, my hands will not stop shaking.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTD_6038;You... you have my gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6039;You have no idea what happened as you wake up on the floor of your [Root.GetChamber], a taste of blood in your mouth and a pounding ache along the side of your face. Slowly, the memories come back. A hooded [Root.GetManWoman]... The Assassins. Perhaps you should consider yourself lucky, getting away with only a black eye.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_6039;A life of secrecy might not be for me, after all.;;;;;;;;;;X

And... is that a dagger in [assassin.GetHerHis] hand?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6104_C;I open my eyes and suddenly I feel wide awake. Something is not right, I can sense it with all my being. Why is the window open...?\nThe whisper emerging from the shadows is soft as silk. "Did you think you could escape the Assassins, [Root.GetFirstName]?";;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6105_B;"No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins." There is nowhere to run. Nothing within reach to use as a weapon. [assassin.GetSheHeCap] points the dagger at me, and says solemnly: "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6105_C;I grasp for the dagger under my pillow, but the shock of this unexpected visit has made my fingers stiff and movement imprecise. Before I can find it, the hooded figure is upon me.

EVTDESC_MNM_6106_B;Due to my extensive preparations, entering the prison of [plot_target.Host.GetTitledFirstName] was almost too easy. The burly jailer had fallen asleep – one less death tonight, it seemed – but [plot_target.GetFirstName] was wide awake when I entered [plot_target.GetHerHis] cell. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [plot_target.GetFirstName].";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_C;[plot_target.GetFirstName] woke with a jerk as I slid through the window, scanning the room with a wild look on [plot_target.GetHerHis] face. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [plot_target.GetFirstName]," I whispered and [plot_target.GetHerHis] head snapped towards the shadowy corner where I stood. [plot_target.GetSheHeCap] reached for something – a weapon, perhaps – but [plot_target.GetSheHe] was not nearly quick enough.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_D;Thanks to my servant's disguise I approached [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] unnoticed. [plot_target.GetHerHisCap] courtiers were loud and jolly, doing their best to forget the misery outside the [plot_target.GetCapitalHolding] walls. As I raised my voice and drew my dagger, however, they all fell silent. "[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6106_E;Once I had reached [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s [plot_target.GetChamber], my task became almost too easy. The feeble [plot_target.GetManWoman] could do nothing to defend [plot_target.GetHerselfHimself], if [plot_target.GetSheHe] was even aware of what was about to happen. "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName]." The moonlight reflected in my dagger as I raised it above my head.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6108_A;"I am here to carry out Allah's judgment, [Root.GetFirstName]." The [assassin.GetManWoman]'s voice rises to a loud shout, "[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!"

EVTDESC_MNM_6108_B;"No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins." There is no where to run. Nothing within reach to use as a weapon. So I shout. As [assassin.GetManWoman] launches [assassin.GetHerselfHimself] at me and in my attempt to defend myself I tear [assassin.GetHerHis] mask off, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_C;I shout as loud as I can. There are voices on the other side of the door, someone trying to tear it open, but they are too late.

EVTDESC_MNM_6108_D;"[Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" As the assassin raises [assassin.GetHerHis] dagger, I grasp for anything within my reach, something to defend myself with. As the weapon tears my flesh I manage to pull down [assassin.GetHerHis] hood, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6108_E;My feeble cries seems to have alerted the guards, but they are too slow. "No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins. [Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [Root.GetFirstName]." As [assassin.GetSheHe] raises the dagger, I struggle and manage to tear off the assassin's mask, revealing a [assassin.GetFaceDescription] face. It is the last thing I see.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_A;At first, everything went according to plan. It was easy to separate [plot_target.GetFirstName] from [plot_target.GetHerHis] guards. However, when the time came to strike, my victim managed to tear of my mask, revealing my face to everyone around us. While it did not save [plot_target.GetHerHim], I almost did not escape.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_B;The burly jailer had fallen asleep, but [plot_target.GetFirstName] was wide awake when I entered [plot_target.GetHerHis] cell. [plot_target.GetSheHeCap] launched [plot_target.GetHerselfHimself] at me, tearing of my mask. My blade slid easily between [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s ribs, but not before [plot_target.GetSheHe] could scream. I barely managed to escape.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_C;[plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] woke with a jerk, scanning the room with a wild look on [plot_target.GetHerHis] face. "Guards!" [plot_target.GetSheHe] shouted, panic in [plot_target.GetHerHis] voice. I could hear movements in the adjacent room, and though they were too slow to save [plot_target.GetFirstName], they almost managed to catch me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_D;[plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] was holding a feast that night. While I managed to approach [plot_target.GetFirstName] unnoticed, [plot_target.GetSheHe] managed to tear off my hood, revealing my face to [plot_target.GetHerHis] entire court. I ended [plot_target.GetHerHim] nonetheless, but was almost caught in the process.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6109_E;When I entered [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s [plot_target.GetChamber] and saw that feeble wretch sleeping in [plot_target.GetHerHis] bed I grew careless. How could this possibly go wrong? However, as I bent over [plot_target.GetFirstName], [plot_target.GetSheHe] opened [plot_target.GetHerHis] eyes and screamed. In the following struggle, my mask was torn off. While my dagger found its target, the guards got a good look at my face before I escaped.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6109;That was... unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6111_A;"I am here to carry out Allah's judgment, [Root.GetFirstName]. [Root.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry]!" The [assassin.GetManWoman] on top of me pulls a dagger from [assassin.GetHerHis] robes. I lunge for it, hitting it out of [assassin.GetHerHis] hand. I shout, drawing the attention of the crowd, and within heartbeats my assailant and I are separated.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_B;"No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins." As the [assassin.GetManWoman] raises [assassin.GetHerHis] dagger, I do the only thing I can think of. I tackle [assassin.GetHerHim] to the filthy cell floor and run. I wake the snoring jailer as I sprint past. [Host.GetSheHeCap] catches me within a few heartbeats, but at least the assassin is gone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_C;I grasp for the dagger under my pillow, but the shock of this unexpected visit has made my fingers stiff and movement imprecise. So I shout, as loud as I can. The guards are forcing their way through the door as I roll off the bed, dodging a dagger. When I scramble to my feet, the assassin is gone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_D;"The time has come for the judgment of Allah!" The [assassin.GetManWoman] reaches for something inside [assassin.GetHerHis] robes, but then someone grabs me from behind, pulling me back. One of the guards tackle the assassin to the floor. There is blood, but it is not my assailant's. A moment later, [assassin.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6111_E;"No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins." There is nothing I can do but scream, so I do. Impressively so. There are echoes of footsteps and clashing metal from outside. Before my assailant can finish the deed, four guards burst through the [Root.GetChamberOpening]. The strange [assassin.GetManWoman] gives me one look and then [assassin.GetSheHe] is gone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6111;I am safe for now, but the Assassins will surely try again.;;;;;;;;;;X

However, as I pulled my dagger, [From.GetSheHe] struck it out of my hand. I was about to reach for a second weapon, but upon hearing [plot_target.GetHerHis] screams, the people around us surged towards [plot_target.GetHerHim], separating us.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_B;The burly jailer had fallen asleep but [plot_target.GetTitledFirstName] was wide awake when I entered [plot_target.GetHerHis] cell. As I lunged at [plot_target.GetHerHim], [plot_target.GetSheHe] managed to dodge me and ran, right into the arms of the jailer. Not wanting to share [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s cell, I slunk into the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_C;"[plot_target.GetAssassinsCrimeOutcry], [plot_target.GetFirstName]!" I announced and the [plot_target.GetManWoman] woke with a jerk.

EVTDESC_MNM_6112_D;"The time has come for the judgment of Allah!" I raised my dagger, ready to strike, but then someone tackled me from behind. I stabbed, blade tearing flesh, hot blood running down my arm. When I got to my feet, [plot_target.GetFirstName] was outside of my reach. There were too many people, and weapons, between us. I turned around and ran.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6112_E;"No one escapes Allah's judgment, or the Assassins," I whispered as I bent over [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s sleeping figure.

EVTDESC_MNM_7830_proud;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] seems to quite enjoy flattery and praise. I could organize a celebration in [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] honor, affirming [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has reason to be haughty. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_deceitful;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s court appears to be in a mild state of confusion. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] seems to have a penchant for telling minor lies and watching the confusion that ensues. I should invite [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] and show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] how much more rewarding the bigger lies are. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_arbitrary;My agents have revealed that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] is not always equally just in his judgments. If [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] were to visit and judge some of my criminals, I could encourage [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to judge based on appearance and whim. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7830_cruel;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s courtiers have learned not to walk too closely by [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] at the top of the staircase. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] seems to quite enjoy them getting hurt. I'm sure [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] would like to see my torture chamber! I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_7832_lustful;The raunchy nights of pleasure and debauchery I hosted at my court for [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] seem to have truly freed [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] from [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] remaining inhibitions. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] is most thankful to me for showing [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] needs not be ashamed of pursuing pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_gluttonous;The lavish feast to which I invited [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] have paid off, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has already started to consume vast quantities of the delicacies I introduced [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to. Before [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] left, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] made sure I understood how grateful [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was for the experience.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_greedy;During our games of chance [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] struggled more and more to hide [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] fondness for the gold coins on the table. With some well-placed words I managed to make [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] come to terms with [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] greed. Letting [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] win most of the games ensured [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] left both thankful and in high spirits.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_slothful;Over the past few days [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I did almost every conceivable thing... except managing a court. I have never seen [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] happier, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] seemed most excited to spend less time ruling and more time enjoying life.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_envious;As we feasted I subtly directed the conversation towards [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s neighbor. Through carefully-dropped hints I convinced [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] that [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] does indeed rightfully covet much that is owned by others. The reinforcing effect this had on [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] envy has already become very clear.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_wroth;I slipped some coins to a servant in return for him bumping into [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] in a hallway during [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] visit. Only a few words from me were needed to unleash [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName]'s anger upon the servant. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] afterwards confessed to me how liberating it was to let out [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] anger, and was most grateful I helped [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to discover this.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_proud;Over the course of the celebrations [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s ego inflated like a bloated cow. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] has already become insufferable to be around, but at least [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was exceedingly grateful that I 'finally recognized [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] greatness'...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_deceitful;As we feasted, I eventually subtly turned the conversation to the small lies [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] uses for [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] amusement. We discussed how [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe], by using [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] talent for lies, could reap far greater rewards than mere 'amusement'. Thoughtfully, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] agreed, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was most thankful to me for opening [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] eyes.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_arbitrary;With my calm support [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] began to visibly enjoy sentencing people based on, for instance, their appearance, or the first sentence of their defense. A grateful [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] afterwards told me [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] far preferred this over the tedious process of listening to lengthy explanations...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_cruel;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] and I had a lot of fun in the dungeons. The prisoners, not so much. Both [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] and I discovered a new side of [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] that was quite... unsettling. Not that it detracted from his gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7832_bonus;It seems that liberating [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] from [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] virtue has had unforeseen effects... Having finally discovered what [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has missed out on for all these years, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] has sunk headlong into utter depravity.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7832;The things I do for [corrupt_priest_spell_caster.GetDWDevil]...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7832_TOOLTIP;[corrupt_priest_spell_caster.GetDWDevil] will surely bless me!\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_7832;I am [corrupt_priest_spell_caster.GetDWDevil]'s greatest servant!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_7832_TOOLTIP;[corrupt_priest_spell_caster.GetDWDevil] will surely bless me greatly!\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7834;Despite my best efforts, one misplaced word was all that was needed for [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] to take offense from my suggestion. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] stormed out of the room indignantly, and what's far worse, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] outed my supposed 'wickedness' to everyone!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7834;Oh no...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7834_TOOLTIP;People will not be happy to hear this...\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_chaste;A lingering touch here, slightly too long a glance there... [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] might not be entirely as chaste as [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] pretends to be. I have just the servant for [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] to meet. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_temperate;Some of [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s servants reportedly saw [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] sneak into the kitchen at night to enjoy some leftovers. If I could speak to [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] in private I am sure I could convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] there is no need for secrecy on these matters. Perhaps [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] would like to visit my court? I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_charitable;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] at times seems almost reluctant to give to others. With a good example [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] could be acquainted with the joys of keeping wealth to yourself. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_diligent;It's almost as if [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] works hard because [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has been taught to, and not because [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] believes [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] should. I should show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] that it is alright not to be a slave to hard work. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_kind;Occasionally [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s smiles and gentle words seem rather forced. With some help I am sure [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] could come to understand that one does not always need to be all smiles with everyone. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_patient;Regular sighs and long, annoyed pauses give away that [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] isn't as patient as is widely thought. Keeping all that frustration pent up inside cannot be healthy. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_humble;At times, when [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] does not receive his due credit, my agents report it almost seems as if [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] is about to speak up. I will show [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] how it feels to be recognized! I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_honest;Honesty has more than once gotten [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] into trouble. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] should learn how to avoid it by using little white lies. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7835_remove_just;[corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] has allegedly voiced [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] annoyance that being just is so time-consuming. Surely I can make [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] see how cutting a few corners could save [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] a lot of time. I shall write the invitation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7835;...and hope my ploy succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_7837_chaste;I saw [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s glances at the servant during our conversation. With a few encouraging words I got them to seclude themselves, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] returned a changed [corrupt_priest_target.GetManWoman]. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most pleased with my support!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_temperate;Having ensured that I caught [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] eating leftovers in the kitchen after our banquet, I managed to soothe [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] worries and convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHim] there was no reason to continue to pretend to have a small appetite. Our next banquet was far more enjoyable...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_charitable;Using a display of wealth, I managed to convince [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] that sometimes money is of better use in one's own pockets. Thoroughly enticed by the prospect, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was most pleased someone had spoken so frankly to him on these matters.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_diligent;I showed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] by example that one can achieve things without working hard. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] truly seemed to enjoy the time spent at my court, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] has already resolved to spend less time working hard when [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] returns home.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_kind;The servant I had bribed continued his insolence for hours, before [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s kindness finally broke. We had a good long discussion afterwards, and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] finally understood that some people are simply not deserving of kindness. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most thankful to me for opening [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] eyes.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_patient;As I heard [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] sigh in frustration at the servant's incompetence, I gave the lad a piece of my mind. Before long, [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName]'s patience ended and [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] joined me in a display of our anger. [corrupt_priest_target.GetFirstName] was incredibly grateful for the release, and seems to have done away with patience since.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_humble;All that was needed was to insist on giving [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] the credit that [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] was due. After some half-hearted attempts at avoiding it, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] finally accepted the praise, and seems to have gotten a taste for recognition now.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_honest;A simple demonstration of talking my way out of an embarrassing situation by using a small lie was enough to get [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] interested. With some explanation and reassurance that nobody would get hurt, [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHe] seems to have finally abandoned [corrupt_priest_target.GetHerHis] honesty.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7837_just;I showed [corrupt_priest_target.GetTitledFirstName] how quickly I judged some of the more bothersome criminals based on my intuition rather than a detailed examination of the facts. [corrupt_priest_target.GetSheHeCap] was most impressed, and has already started following my example!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7837;I am so altruistic!;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_7841;In the middle of the night, I seclude myself in the room I have meticulously prepared for tonight's [Root.GetDWDarkMagic]. With every step of the ritual completed, the air in the room grows more and more oppressing, until finally I sense I am about to unleash a being of terrible power upon my unsuspecting foe.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_7843;The ritual was a resounding success! [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName] seems to have taken quite a liking to me, and is now far more amenable to my suggestions. The unfortunate side effect is that [possess_courtier_target.GetSheHe] has become quite obviously... insane.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7843;Exactly as planned.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7844;Not everything has gone according to plan. Although something quite clearly seems to have taken up residence within [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName], whatever it is does not seem to be inclined to make [possess_courtier_target.GetFirstName] more loyal towards you...;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_7845;The ritual has failed completely. Whether [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s mind proved too strong, or due to some other reason, the entity did not manage to take a hold of [possess_courtier_target.GetHerHim]. [possess_courtier_target.GetFirstName]'s mind has completely shattered in the process, however.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7845;How... Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_7845_TOOLTIP;§Y[possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName]§! retains their free will, or what remains of it.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_7847;Despite [possess_courtier_target.GetTitledFirstName]'s frequent bouts of madness, [possess_courtier_target.GetSheHe] has indeed been loyal so far. Which is why it comes as such a surprise to hear [possess_courtier_target.GetHerHis] characteristic cackling laughter behind you as cold steel sinks into your back.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_4601_SLOTHFUL;[benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetSisterBrotherCap] [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetFirstName]'s slothfulness has long been known in the Order, subjecting [benedictines_diligent_mentee.GetHerHim] to its scorn.

EVTDESC_MNM_8020;It is the season of the monsoon and rain is pouring down. Roads turn to mud and crops wash away. The life of a pilgrim can sometimes be a hard and arduous one.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8020;My faith will keep me strong and safe.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8020;I regret setting out on this adventure.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8021;The dry season is upon us and there is no water in sight. A pilgrim's life can sometimes harsh and unforgiving but it is clear this is taking a heavier toll on the villages I pass by than it does on me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8021;I must attempt to alleviate their suffering.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8021;Such is life in the dry season.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8022;Any traveller would balk at the prospect of traversing hills and jungle but it was the shorter route. Emerging from the undergrowth however it is becoming increasingly clear that I have made a mistake. The road ahead is not necessarily as dangerous as what now lies behind, but it is quite clearly not the right road.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8022;I knew I shouldn't have trusted those locals!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8022;I should have paid better attention to their instructions.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_8022;Let's explore this area and learn more about life in the jungle!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8023;A large group of mounted warriors block our way. The local Raja is a man that has taken it upon himself to relieve pilgrims, merchants or other travelers of some of their wealth in order to allow them passage. Turning back is not an option, either we pay or we will have to fight these men.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8023;Pay them their fee.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8023;We must defend what is ours!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8024;It has been days since we last saw a settlement and deep forests surround us on all sides. The small road we have been following has all but disappeared in the thick undergrowth. As I look up I can make out a huge creature native to this jungle on the other side.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8024;Turn, and run!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8024;I must fight this beast!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8025;Since this journey began I have come to pass through many cities and villages. Few have been as poor as the settlement that now lies before us. Men, women and children live in such poverty that it is hard to see how they can endure, and yet... These are some of the happiest people I have ever come across!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8025;I can learn much from these villagers.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8025;I will teach them about the ways of the real world!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8026;A pilgrimage is as much an inner adventure as it is a journey through the physical realm. As my goal grows ever closer the people I meet and the places I see has made me reflect and re-evaluate things I thought I knew about life.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8026;This is a marvelous opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8026;It is time to rest.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8027;As we looked for a place to set up camp at the end of a long day we stumbled across a sentry. Having examined our group he decided that we are harmless pilgrims and bid us to enter the camp of his master, a rich vaishya merchant of the southern trade guilds.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8027;I must thank them for their kindness.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8027;They are only giving me what is my right.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8028;Everything seems to taste foul today. Was it the local cuisine or that night spent camping in a swamp? It is hard to say for sure but something is not right with this pilgrim...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8028;A small offering and then I must continue onwards.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8028;It is time to rest and heal.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8029;You come across a thriving city in the middle of a dry upland. The secret of their prosperity seems to be huge water tanks, built and maintained by the local Raja. A separate reservoir is also under construction to allow the city to grow even bigger. You stop to admire this feat of engineering and cannot help wondering how much a similar construction could benefit [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8029;I must learn more about these reservoirs.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8029;Such a futile endeavor, rain falls where it wills.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8030;In the middle of a small village stands an unusually large pipal tree. The villagers have built a platform of grass and mud around its center, this is clearly a place for spiritual reflection and discussion.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8030;I must stay and learn what these people can teach me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8030;I have no time to lose.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8031;After a trek of many days through unfamiliar lands I now stand before an unfamiliar but dazzingly splendid city. Houses of rich and poor alike are made of stone and on the central hilltop a citadel looks out over massive water reservoirs to keep the inhabitants supplied with water at all times.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8031;Let us rest and enjoy city life!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8031_TOOLTIP;You will make new acquaintances.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8031;City life is an unnecessary diversion.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8034;Following an audience with the local Raja you spend the rest of the day exploring the city. Its central position along a major trade route attracts travelers from all over the region. Among the many travelers you meet a [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetManWoman] entirely after your own mind. Your meeting does not last long but as you part your new friend invites you to visit [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetHerHim] in [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetHerHis] native [home_of_new_friend.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8034_common_origin;Following an audience with the local Raja you spend the rest of the day exploring the city. Its central position along a major trade route attracts travelers from all over the region. Among the many travelers you unexpectedly meet an old acquaintance from home.  [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetName] is also on the road and you use this opportunity to get to know each other better. You find that [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetSheHe] is a [new_friend_far_away_from_home.GetManWoman] entirely after your own mind and as you part you promise to see each other again in [home_of_new_friend.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8034;I have made a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8035;As I entered the city I was quickly invited to the citadel of the local Raja.

EVTDESC_MNM_8036;Spending time and money in a city is a good way to make new acquaintances. I cannot help however this has been a day wasted on my journey.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8036;It is time we continue towards our goal.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8037;It has been months since I left my home behind. I cannot help but wonder how my house and family fares without me. Surely I arranged things as well as possible before I left however, who could I trust if not friends and family?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8037;I am sure everything is fine.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8037;I cannot let go of these thoughts...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8050;Arrival in Sarnath;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8050;A short journey from the holy city of Varanasi lies Sarnath. This is the park in which Buddha gave his first sermons, setting the wheel of the Dharma in motion, telling his followers of the four noble truths and founding the Sangha itself. Today the park is home to the imposing Dhamek Stupa and over a thousand priests and monks.\n\nThis is one of the most bustling centers of Buddhist teachings in India and one of the sites named by the Buddha himself as a worthy pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8050;I must seek the middle way.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8051;Bodh Gaya;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8051;You have finally arrived in Bodh Gaya, by many considered the seat of Buddhism. It was here that Buddha once sat under the tree of enlightenment, meditating on the mysteries of the universe. Over the centuries rulers and influentials both in India and further away have contributed to a great number of temples, monasteries and shrines at this post. To this day the monks of Bodh Gaya has kept a giant Bodhi Tree alive here, a huge pipal right next to the 'Diamond Throne' that a ruler of another age built to commemorate the event.\n\nAs you approach the blue tiled walls of the massive Mahabodhi temple you reflect on how different this site must be from when Buddha himself came here. At that point he was not unlike yourself, a simple ascetic seeking enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8051;I too seek to be enlightened.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8052;Sanchi;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8052;You have finally arrived in Sanchi, one of the oldest centers of Buddhist worship in the world. Legend has it the original Stupa here was constructed by Emperor Ashoka at the insistence of his Vidishan queen Devi. Ever since Buddhists have been coming here to seek out the serenely secluded environment, and over hundreds of years more temples, stupas and monasteries have sprung up in this ideal place for monastic life.\n\nAs you approach the elaborate Torana of the ancient Great Stupa of Ashoka you reflect on the generations of faithful that have walked this way before you as well as on the fate of Sariputra and Mahamoggalana whose relics lie within.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8052;As is fitting for a disciple of Buddha.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8053;Shravanabelagola;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8053;You have finally arrived in Shravanabelagola, the white pond of the Shravana. For centuries great monks and Sravakas have meditated here on the hills of Chandragiri and Vindhyagiri, among them even great kings and emperors. As you approach the main pond you reflect on the faith of Bahubali whose atonement for his sins and sublimation into godhood is commemorated here by a 57 feet statue in his likeness. Shravanabelagola is the site of many Jain mathas and temples and is the site where some of the holiest scriptures are kept.\n\nFortunately you have arrived in time for the Mahamastakabhisheka ceremony and get to watch as the statue of Bahubali is bathed and anointed and sprinkled with powders of Sandalwood and Vermilion.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8053;It is time I proceed to the temples and mathas of this place.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8054;Girnar;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8054;You have arrived in the temple district of Taleti at the foot of Girnar. A long set of stairs will take you up the sacred mountain to see the shrines and temples. It was here that Krishna was once confined by his mother and where he tricked Kalayavana to meet the inflaming ire of the sleeping Muchukunda.\n\nAs you reach the Bhavnat shrine you observe the hundreds of naked Sadhus making their offerings to Shiva and bathing themselves in the tank of the temple. The entire place is resounding with sounds and music and according to some Shiva himself is near.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8054;I must continue my ascent.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8055;Arrival at Shikarji;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8055;Having crossed the Madhuban forest, you have finally reached the foot of the Parasnath hills and the pilgrimage of Shikarji. On these mountain peaks 20 out of the 24 tirthankaras achieved moksha through meditation making this one of the holiest of places in the world. Their ascent to Nirvana has left a permanent mark on this place, and during your climb upwards to the sacred peaks you pass the small marble tonks left to commemorate each and every one of them.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8055;It is time to begin my ascent.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8056;Arrival in Mathura.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8056;You have finally arrived at the heart of Braj, in Mathura, the place where lord Krishna was once born. It is said the first temple constructed at this ancient site was built by Vajranabha, the great-grandson of Krishna himself. Since then the devoted have travelled to this place to give their offerings and see this most holy of Hindu places. Today thousands of pilgrims come here, and to the nearby Vrindavan where Krishna spent his youth, every year to circumambulate Govardhana and the other temples.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8056;It is beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8057;The Eternal City;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8057;At the confluence of the Varuna and the Assi lies one of the oldest cities of India. Known by names such as Varanasi, Kasi or Banaras this is also one of the holiest places in the world. For thousands of years pilgrims have visited the hundreds of temples and the many ghats that lead into the holy river Ganges. They have sought enlightenment and purification or in some cases, to die in this place where salvation is guaranteed.\n\nEager to perform your own cleansing you approach the Dashashwamedh Ghats, a set of stairs said to have been created to welcome Shiva by lord Brahma millennia ago, you reflect on Ganges, Krishna and the cycle of rebirth.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8057;I believe it is time for a bath!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8061;This place is invigorating to the mind. Being able to engage with so many great minds of religion and theology has stimulated my understanding and willingness to explore the finer points of the faith. Hours and even days are lost in conversation with Sadhus, Priests and Monks about the deeper meaning of various passages in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8061;Enlightenment can only be achieved through Meditation.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8062;Purification and Enlightenment have never before felt as tangible as in this place. Pilgrims are circumambulating shrines, sadhus are conveying their blessings upon the faithful and monks and gurus meditate together. I join those in worship that for thousands of years have attended this place and others like it. This is a profound experience unlike anything I have ever felt before.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8062;I cannot wait to tell others about this!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8063;Many pilgrims have stories of the experiences from their journeys and the great enlightenment or purification achieved in at the destination. I expected much more than I have found here. The place is certainly full of monks, sadhus, priests and holy men but neither circumambulation, meditation or cleansing has left me with anything but an empty feeling of doubt.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8063;What is my purpose here?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8064;Eager to engage other in discussion I rushed right ahead to the centers of learning. I can tell the ideas and thoughts I have had over the years have made an impression on others here. Even great minds, scholars and sadhus alike seem taken by my reasoning and my home-grown theological arguments.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8064;It is but a small contribution to the knowledge of mankind.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8065;There are people here from every corner of the world. Though we are united in reverence of this holy place their languages, clothes and even the people themselves seem exotic and different. Meeting and conversing with strangers is in itself an experience that will impact me more than the religious aspects of this pilgrimage itself.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8065;I must talk to them all!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8065;I must observe and learn about the peoples of this world.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8066;A pilgrimage can be undertaken for many reasons. For some it is a way to atone for past sins, for others a way to repay the universe for what they have. To many the pilgrimage is a great and rejuvenating journey. I feel convinced this is so, for my journey has left me invigorated in a way I have never experienced before.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8066;Perhaps the time has come to begin the journey home?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8067;Like me many others have come here to seek the spiritual experience of their life. To some this is draining but I find it to be quite invigorating. With the appetite of the mind sated perhaps it is time to enjoy myself?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8067;Yes, why not?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8067;I must exercise control of the body as well as the mind.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_8068;Healer?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8068;A holy place such as this has always attracted mystics, sadhus and yogis. After completing my cleansing bath in the Ganges and started to climb back up the ghats I met an old wrinkled man who bestowed his blessing upon me. Ever since I have felt more powerful and invigorated.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8068_b;A holy place such as this has always attracted mystics, sadhus and yogis. Knowing that their blessings are said to have great power I could not help but seek out one who is said to have a way to heal the sick. I spent some time with this man and ate and drank a variety of things according to his instructions. For the most part it is hard to remember what happened but it appears I slept for several days before leaving him with a feeling of invigoration I have not felt for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8068;I have been healed by a higher power!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8068;This man was truly a great healer.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_8068;I must learn more about this mystery!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8070;Surrounded by pilgrims, temples and shrines it is hard not to be taken aback by the great faith of the masses. Their reverence really is quite endearing. Should I reveal my true identity to them and receive their open adoration and worship? What better place to do this than here, a destination they have all sought out to experience my favor...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8070;Let them see me for who I truly am!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8070;They could not bear to receive me in full glory, for now I must spare them.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8071;Enrichment of the spirit is all well and good but perhaps it is now time to see what the temporal world has to offer. Surely there is both food, good company and good drink to be had nearby? Now that I am here I must sate my appetite for the local delicacies.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8071;Let us see what this place truly has to offer...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_8071;I must strive to overcome the crass demands of flesh and bone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8072;The adoration I thought I saw was clearly nothing but blind stupidity! These pilgrims are fools and do not know the full extent of my power. The lucky ones may never find out but those that ejected me from the temple grounds will curse this day.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8072;They do not realize what they have awoken...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8091;I am home at last after my journey. I have learnt new things, experienced the greatness of the faith and met with interesting people. While it is good to be home I am confident that I will always remember this trip very fondly.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8091;A great experience!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8092;I am home at last after a long journey. While it is said that a pilgrimage can rejuvenate the soul and body I cannot claim it did for me. On the whole this has been a most disappointing experience.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_8092;My home is my castle.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_8093;I am finally home after a long and tiring journey. Though the insolent rats did not recognize me or pay proper homage, it was still an enlightening experience. Now there is plenty of time to prepare their day of reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_CYNICAL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. While I was skeptical at first, I have found much truth in the words of [Root.GetMOSaint]. This is truly a path worth treading. I am a doubter no more.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_GLUTTONOUS;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have followed this holy path, I have reigned in my bodily desires for food and other physical excesses.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_GREEDY;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have followed this holy path, I have felt my need for material goods diminish. I no longer crave excess and indulgences.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_SLOTHFUL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Following in the footsteps of [Root.GetMOSaint] has motivated me to be more active and spend my time on matters of greater importance than naps and games.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_ENVIOUS;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have striven to be more like [Root.GetMOSaint] I have also realized that I rarely envy the fortune of others anymore.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_WROTH;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. I used to get angered by the smallest things, but lately I have striven to be more like [Root.GetMOSaint] and nowadays I barely notice that which used to annoy me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_PROUD;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. In my attempts to become more like [Root.GetMOSaint], I have striven to think less of myself and more of others. The sense of pride which once shackled me is gone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_DECEITFUL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Once, I used lies and deceit to get out of trouble and fulfill my desires. Following the path of [Root.GetMOSaint] has taught me better.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_CRUEL;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Studying the works and life of [Root.GetMOSaint] has made me realize the error of my ways. I have promised myself to treat others with less ire and more compassion.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_HUMBLE;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. As I have followed this holy path, I have noticed that my sense of ego and need for recognition has all but vanished. This change has helped me focus on the things which really matter.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_CHARITABLE;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Since I joined [Root.Society.GetName] I have practiced charity, yet it was not until today I realized I was truly glad to let go of my personal possessions. Helping those in need is truly fulfilling.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_CHASTE;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Abstaining from my bodily desires has allowed me to connect with people on a much deeper level. I also find that my mind is clearer and more peaceful than it has ever been before.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_KIND;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. Following in the footsteps of [Root.GetMOSaint], I have realized the value of kindness. Every display of compassion brings us closer to a purer, gentler and holier world.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_TEMPERATE;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. In my quest to live like [Root.GetMOSaint] I have avoided indulgences and impulsive actions. Each time I have been tested, my self-control has grown, and now I resist most desires with an ease I have never experienced previously.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_HONEST;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. On this holy path I have discovered the value of being true, to myself as well as others. Once I would lie to hide my sin and shame, however, I no longer feel I have anything to hide.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_REMOVE_AMBITIOUS;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. It took time and effort, but finally studying the life of [Root.GetMOSaint] has shown me the error of my ways. I will no longer strive to obtain personal glory – I live to serve [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_CONTENT;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. By following this holy path I have shed my material and prideful desires, one by one. Now I am truly content with my place in this world and no longer crave more.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_PATIENT;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. By studying the life of [Root.GetMOSaint], I have found the value of patience and acceptance. This realization has granted me the peace of mind I never thought I would have.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4400_ADD_DILIGENT;My wish to become a better [Root.GetReligiousPerson] has led me to [Root.GetMOCode]. I no longer feel the need to serve my own desires – I would much rather labor to make this world a better place for everyone in it. In my work I have found a true connection to the divine.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_4405_LUSTFUL;During my time [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] I have spent many long hours contemplating my carnal desires. Despite my attempts to stay true to [Root.GetMOCode], I can never seem to restrict myself around [Root.GetMenWomenPreference]! As I sit here in solitude, ignoring that relentless heat in the pit of my stomach is getting harder and harder...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4405_LUSTFUL;If I find a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] to quench my lust with, I can focus afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_4406_LUSTFUL_A;I waited until midnight before I left my chambers and hurried towards the quarters of [holy_seclusion_lover.GetTitledFirstName]. [holy_seclusion_lover.GetSheHeCap] greeted me with the sweetest of smiles and in [holy_seclusion_lover.GetHerHis] arms, all of my wishes were fulfilled. When I returned to my chambers some hours later, the [Root.Location.GetHolding] was still deserted.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4406_LUSTFUL_B;I waited until midnight before I left my chambers and hurried towards the servants' quarters. There I found a [Root.GetManWomanPreference] with the sweetest of smiles that told me all of my wishes would be fulfilled. When I returned to my chambers some hours later, the [Root.Location.GetHolding] was still deserted.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_4407_LUSTFUL;I waited until midnight before I left my seclusion and ventured out in the [Root.Location.GetHolding] to find a willing lover. I visited the chambers of the [Root.GetMenWomenPreference] I had shared a bed with before, but all of them were either asleep or uninterested. As morning approached I returned to my lonely bed, where I spent some time with a fantasy before drifting off to sleep...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4407_LUSTFUL;Well, that was a futile effort.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4408_LUSTFUL;At first, every day I went without a [Root.GetManWomanPreference]'s touch felt like torture. At night it was all I dreamed about and during the day I could hardly think about anything else. But then, somehow, it got easier. I became more comfortable in my solitude and adhering to [Root.GetMOCode] does not feel as impossible as it once did.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_4409_LUSTFUL;I tried to ignore the thoughts, but it was impossible! In the end, I could not take it anymore, and snuck out one evening to visit the local brothel. Afterwards, I returned to my chambers, thinking that was the end of it. However, it turns out that someone saw me, and now everyone knows!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4409_LUSTFUL;I must learn to control this!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4405_GLUTTONOUS;I know that [Root.GetMOSaint] was a paragon of temperance, however I struggle to control my appetite. While [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation], I am supposed to eat very simple food in small portions, but I am growing weary. I cannot concentrate when my stomach rumbles like this!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4405_GLUTTONOUS;After a little treat I shall return to my duties with doubled focus!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_4405_GLUTTONOUS;I shall defeat my desires with a fast!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4406_GLUTTONOUS;I waited until midnight before I made my way to the kitchens. I found some of my favorite treats in one of the pantries. After many days on the most dreary of diets, they tasted like the most delicious food I had ever eaten! My appetite is satiated for now and no one is the wiser.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4406_GLUTTONOUS;That was exactly what I needed.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4407_GLUTTONOUS;After midnight I ventured to the kitchens to find something to still my hunger. I quickly found my favorite treats and proceeded to shove handfuls into my mouth. However, my binge was interrupted as a servant entered the room. As I hid in the pantry, the shame washed over me, and I could not eat anything else.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4407_GLUTTONOUS;Now I just feel nauseated...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4408_GLUTTONOUS;During the first days of my fast, I felt as if I was going to die. As I woke on the third day, however, I was surprised by how clear my mind was and how little the lack of sustenance bothered me. The next day when I broke my fast and returned to my simple diet, it was more than enough to satisfy me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4408_GLUTTONOUS;I am stronger than I thought.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4409_GLUTTONOUS;The first day of the fast went reasonably well, but on the second one, I woke up ravenous. I thought I would die! I hurried to the kitchen, ignoring the servants' stares. Once there I proceeded to shove anything edible I could find into my mouth, not caring who saw me. Now everyone knows about my failure!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4409_GLUTTONOUS;How could I shame myself so?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4405_GREEDY;My [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] always talks about the importance of charity, and I do give alms to the poor on a regular basis. However, I often feel reluctant when doing so, and it brings me shame. While [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation], I have had plenty of time to think about this. Perhaps I should strive to be more charitable?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4405_GREEDY;I still give, don't I? Surely that must be enough.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_4405_GREEDY;I don't give enough. I will make another donation!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4406_GREEDY;After coming to the realization that I am already doing so much for my subjects as their [Root.GetTitle], I have been able to put the thought about charity out of my mind. It does not distract me any longer.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4406_GREEDY;I am a good [Root.GetReligiousPerson], on the whole.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4407_GREEDY;I thought I was happy with my decision, but then the guilt came creeping. I should not crave money and possessions in this way. These feelings are not in accordance with [Root.GetMOCode], but I cannot help myself.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4407_GREEDY;I am a good [Root.GetReligiousPerson], am I not? Surely?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4408_GREEDY;I ordered one of my most trusted servants to take a substantial sum of money from my personal treasury and bring it to the local [Root.GetMOBuilding]. Strangely enough, when [Root.GetSheHe] left, I felt... relief. Perhaps this is the first step towards freeing myself of the desire for material possessions?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4408_GREEDY;The money will come to good use, I am sure.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4409_GREEDY;I wish I wouldn't have acted so rashly...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4405_SLOTHFUL;For a true follower of [Root.GetMOCode], the importance of saying [Root.GetPrayers] and studying [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] – at least my [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] says so. However, while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] for days on end, I struggle to stay focused. Sometimes I feel that I am just sitting here, doing nothing. If I closed my eyes for just a moment... surely that would not be so bad?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4405_SLOTHFUL;A little nap would do me good.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_4405_SLOTHFUL;If I am getting tired, I must double my efforts!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4406_SLOTHFUL;I was so immensely bored by my [Root.GetPrayers] and [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], but after a little nap my duties did not feel quite so impossible anymore. I cannot expect myself to become like [Root.GetMOSaint] overnight. One step at a time, I say!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4406_SLOTHFUL;That was wise of me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4407_SLOTHFUL;Waking up was an unpleasant experience, to say the least. I had sunk to the floor and also managed to get drool all over the chest of my garb. When I sluggishly pushed myself back to seated, I was aghast to realize that the room was pitch black! It was in the middle of the night and every single candle had burned out.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4407_SLOTHFUL;It was only supposed to be a little nap!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4408_SLOTHFUL;During the first hours every minute felt like an eternity, but then it got easier. My weariness was as good as gone and a certain passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] grabbed my interest. I kept reading, consumed by the powerful words, and suddenly it was morning! I went to sleep with a smile upon my lips and a renewed sense of purpose.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_4408_SLOTHFUL;Self-control is far greater a reward than indulgence.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_4409_SLOTHFUL;I do not remember falling asleep, but suddenly I realized I was sprawled across the floor. Apparently I had crashed on top of my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], because once I struggled to my feet I noticed that its pages were torn and that I had ink smeared across my face. No matter how hard I tried, I could not wash it off. Surely my servants are gossiping about my failure, and soon everyone will know!;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_4410;For me, the biggest challenge while [Root.GetMOPenanceMeditation] is the solitude. As I sit here and reflect upon [Root.GetMOCode], thoughts enter my mind which I desperately want to share with someone, but I have barely exchanged a single word since I began my seclusion. I glance out of my window only to see [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] engaged in a lively conversation with some friends.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_4410;I will go down there and join them, if only for a few minutes!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_4410;I should stay here, alone with my thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_4411;While [potential_friend.GetTitledFirstName] and [potential_friend.GetHerHis] friends were surprised to see me, they were excellent company! As I stood there, surrounded by people, I could not stop talking. What was supposed to be a few minutes turned into an hour before my companions had to excuse themselves and get back to their duties.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_4411;That was nice, although I know I shouldn't have.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_4412;This is the challenge I have been given, and I will not give up so quickly. I returned to my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and continued where I had left off. During the first few pages, thoughts about the jolly friends in the courtyard kept distracting me, but after a while I found peace in my reading.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_4412;Being alone is not so bad, after all.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_4413;I left the window and returned to my copy of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] and continued where I had left off. However, my heart was not really in it, and thoughts about the jolly friends in the courtyard kept distracting me.

EVTDESC_MNM_4414;I cannot make sense of this passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]! The words are archaic and their meaning is deeply hidden by copious layers of symbolism.

EVTDESC_MNM_4415;A true follower of [Root.GetMOCode] does not give up easily. I kept at it, reading the passage again and again, compared it with other holy texts and mulled over the wording for hours at end. It went slowly, but every now and then I uncovered a new piece of the puzzle, and suddenly, I saw it! Such elegance, such depth! I will carry this revelation with me until the day I die.;;;;;;;;;;X

With [court_spiritual.GetFirstName]'s patient guidance, I managed to make sense of it at the end!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_4418;I immediately sought out [court_spiritual.GetJobTitle] [court_spiritual.GetFirstName] to request [court_spiritual.GetHerHis] aid. I seemed to have caught [court_spiritual.GetHerHim] at a bad time, however, for [court_spiritual.GetSheHe] agreed with some discernible reluctance.

I then failed to engage my [interrupting_child.GetDaughterSon] in a conversation about the passage, so I considered myself defeated and sent [interrupting_child.GetHerHim] on [interrupting_child.GetHerHis] way.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_4424;I patiently explained to [interrupting_child.GetFirstName] that I was preoccupied with holy duties, and that I would return to court once they were finished.

the_cold_ones_desc;The Cold Ones believe that certain people are born with witch's blood and it is their blessing to be able to turn to Chernobog, the Black God, to gain power and wealth.

EVTDESC_3399;Starting today, I shall dedicate myself to convincing the court of my deep devoutness, in the name of the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] faith and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. My allies in [This.Society.GetName] will understand. This is a necessary step if I am to ever convince my people to see the path I, nay, [Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] has actually laid out before them. They will thank me later.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3399;I'll make them see.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3202;My advisors inform me that [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName] has been overheard questioning my loyalty to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. When I summon [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHim], [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] is apologetic, but a raised eyebrow tells of [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] doubt. "It's just a rumor, my [Root.GetLordLady]... You are not overly interested in [Root.GetReligiousRite], but you could surely quote any passage of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] without hesitation...?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3202;Of course I could, [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_3202;You should not be questioning me. I am your [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_3202;Is there any way I can make you think otherwise, [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName]...?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3204;As I began reciting [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName]'s eyes widened. I intentionally focused on what I believed to be [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] favorite passage, speaking clearly to [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] interests as a [stubborn_courtier.GetEducationRole]. My gambit seems to have paid off because the deep bow [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] bestowed upon me was nothing short of embarrassment and an eagerness to make up for [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] obvious blunder.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3204;That about do it for you, [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3205;As I rack my brain for the appropriate lines to shove triumphantly in [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName]'s face, my palms grow sweaty.\n"Ezekiel 25:17! I will carry out great vengeance on them..." I begin. Then a slow panic begins to rise within my chest. [stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName] frowns. \n"No, wait, that doesn't seem right. That's not..." I mumble as [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] shakes [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] head and with a roll of [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] eyes walks away, leaving me alone with my failure. By the damnation of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], how did I get this so wrong?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3205;I've made a fool of myself.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3206;I make it clear to [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledName] that it seems almost heretical for someone supposedly well-versed in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName] to display such a poor understanding of the relationship between a ruler and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n[stubborn_courtier.GetFirstName] clearly did not expect to have their own religious understanding challenged, and I try not to smile to myself as [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] sputters an apology. As [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] prepares to leave, I remind [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHim] that many questions can be dangerous to ask.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3206;[stubborn_courtier.GetSheHeCap] understands my veiled threat.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3207;My voice must not have sounded as threatening as I believed it to. When I told [stubborn_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] how it could be dangerous to ask the wrong questions, [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] only laughed. As I followed up with stories of other unfortunate souls who had questioned their liege's faith, [stubborn_courtier.GetHerHis] grin remained. When [stubborn_courtier.GetSheHe] finally departed, it was with an even more disconcerting sentence. "I know exactly where my soul belongs, but I am unsure about yours.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3207;No, wait! I know lines of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3251;[Root.GetSRGreeting], [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\n\nWe are proud to hear of your valiant efforts to remain an undetected member of [This.Society.GetName].

EVTOPTA_MNM_3252;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3209;[concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] has come to me as a friend, to inquire about my wellbeing. "I feel as though I never see you pray anymore, is something heavy burdening your mind?" [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] asks.\nI think of my true beliefs, and how they need to be kept secret, even of those closest to me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3209;Oh, I have been having these terrible dreams.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_3209;I... Everything is fine.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_3209;Actually, I've been meaning to speak to you about [concerned_friend.GetEducationalTopicPlural].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3211;I regale [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] with tales of my "dark dreams" of strange and foreign rituals. [concerned_friend.GetSheHeCap] can barely believe the vividness with which I describe the faith of the unbelievers. Afterwards [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] offers me a listening ear for whenever I may be burdened like this again.\nIf only [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] knew.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3211;[concerned_friend.GetFirstName] is a good, loyal and trusting [concerned_friend.GetRootRelation].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3212;As I describe my "dark dreams," [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName]'s expression grows ever more concerned. "You recall these dreams very well," [concerned_friend.GetSheHe] says. "Almost more like memories."\n[concerned_friend.GetFirstName] doesn't comment on it again, but later you worry that you may have made [concerned_friend.GetHerHim] more worried, not less.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3212;I think I gave away too much.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3213;I tried to reassure [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] that everything is as it should, and soon enough we were conversing and laughing like we used to. When the evening was over, [concerned_friend.GetFirstName] looked me in the eyes. "It is good to see that all is well with you after all.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3213;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_3214;I tried to reassure [concerned_friend.GetTitledFirstName] that everything is as it should, but my mind would not stay still. Did they already know the truth about my faith? As our conversation drifted onto theology, I briskly told [concerned_friend.GetHerHim] that I had to retire for the evening. I barely said goodbye before I had them escorted out.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_3214;I could have handled that better.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3220_TRUSTING;I have been thinking about my efforts to blend into the [Root.Religion.GetGroupName] community and while I am aware of what is expected of me, I am often overcome with the desire to talk to someone. Perhaps [trusted_friend.GetTitledName]? Surely [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] would understand my struggle?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3220_SHY;Being a [Root.GetTrueReligionAdherent], but pretending that I am not, has begun to make me shy away of conversation on religious matters. From the frown on some people's faces, I worry that my indecision is becoming noticeable.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3220_HONEST;The weight of carrying my beliefs in secret is becoming increasingly difficult. I am not fond of lying, and so when [trusted_friend.GetFirstName] bids me farewell after an audience, and [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] blesses me in the name of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I shift uncomfortably in my seat.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3220_TRUSTING;I'll summon a meeting.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3220_SHY;If I don't have anything intelligent to say, it's better that I am quiet.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3220_HONEST;I can't pretend all the time.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_3220_TRUSTING;I can't trust anyone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_3220_SHY;I need to play along more.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_3220_HONEST;The show must go on.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3221_TRUSTING;[trusted_friend.GetTitledName] joined me for a walk today, and I must admit to feeling better after talking to [trusted_friend.GetHerHim]. While I left out the most important details of my current spiritual anxieties, [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] concluded our meeting by placing an encouraging hand on my shoulder. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us – I am sure of it, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3221_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural], somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology. When prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I offered them my most stony gaze in return. "Of course, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Your opinion is obviously that of the traditional scholars. Our apologies.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3221_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] I reply that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] certainly could treat us better. [trusted_friend.GetFirstName] hesitates for a second, but then laughs. "You have such nerve, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] says. "It's all in jest, my friend" I say, only half-faking my smile.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3221_TRUSTING;We will see, friend.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_3222_TRUSTING;[trusted_friend.GetTitledName] joined me for a walk today, and at first I felt a lot better simply talking to [trusted_friend.GetHerHim]. I struggled to leave out the details of my current spiritual anxieties, but [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] shot me glances of concern throughout our meeting. As we parted, [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] placed a gentle hand on my shoulder. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is with us – I am sure of it... Even if you are not, my [Root.GetLordLady].";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3222_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology... When I was finally prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I shrunk into my chair and mumbled something about us all perhaps making an effort to get along. "[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] wouldn't want us to squabble", I concluded, but they did not seem convinced.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3222_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I am at a loss for words. "Something the matter, my [Root.GetLordLady]?" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] asks. "It's nothing", I say, but [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] does not seem convinced. "I know you are struggling with your faith, my friend" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] then says, before continuing: "– but you must stop. For the sake of the realm.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3222_TRUSTING;Oh no! I cannot afford rumors of my faith wavering!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3222_SHY;I'm not sure what I should have said?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3222_HONEST;Is it that obvious?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3223_TRUSTING;I invited [trusted_friend.GetTitledName] to a walk today. While not disclosing too much, I gently steered our conversation towards [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] theological views. "I think perhaps that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is just a name, for a concept we share with many, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] admitted in the end.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3223_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology.

"Of course, my [Root.GetLordLady]. Our apologies.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3223_HONEST;The next time [trusted_friend.GetTitledFirstName] bids me farewell with a blessing of [trusted_friend.GetHerHis] [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I reply that [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] has already blessed me, with the companionship we share. [trusted_friend.GetFirstName] gives an earnest smile. "Always so eloquent, my [Root.GetLordLady]". "Only among my friends" I respond, giving a mock bow.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3223_TRUSTING;Interested indeed.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_3224_TRUSTING;I have been avoiding [trusted_friend.GetTitledName] for some time now. When [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] eventually caught me, it was awkward. "Something has changed in you, my [Root.GetLordLady]" [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] said stiffly. My stomach lurched. "It is not you, it is I", I confessed. Then I told [trusted_friend.GetHerHim] that I've been doubting [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s plan for me. [trusted_friend.GetSheHeCap] seemed unimpressed. I hope I have not said too much.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_3224_SHY;During a meeting today, what started as an idle discussion on the subject of [Root.GetEducationalTopicPlural] somehow got my councilors into a heated debate over theology... When I was finally prompted about my own opinion on the matter, I shrunk into my chair. "Surely, we have more important things to discuss", I mumbled. "More important than [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], my [Root.GetLordLady]?" came the retort, aghast.;;;;;;;;;;X

"I refused to believe the rumors, but you truly do not believe in our [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] anymore, do you? My [Root.GetTitle], you'll doom us all.";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_3224_TRUSTING;I thought [trusted_friend.GetSheHe] would understand.;;;;;;;;;;X

secret_religious_society_zoroastrian_desc;Believing themselves to be the protectors of understanding and knowledge in a world under the spell of Ahriman's ignorance, Zoroastrians organizing in secret spread the truth and light of Ahura Mazda's wisdom. Charged by their prophet with protecting the water, earth, fire and air, they enlighten others about the struggle between destructive chaos and the good of creation. Even when forced into secrecy there is yet hope, for Zoroaster told of the inevitability of Ahura Mazda's victory.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_norse_pagan_reformed;the Oathkeepers;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_norse_pagan_reformed_desc;Knowing of the inevitable coming of Ragnarok, as foretold in their saga scriptures, Norse believers will work even in secret to prepare the world for the snowy hell of the Fimbulvetr and the great battles of all-consuming fire it presages. Practicing their secret rituals in the name of the Allfather, they will accept any kind of warrior who can stand with them in the struggle against the chaos and desolation that other faiths seem intent on bringing upon the world.;;;;;;;;;;X

secret_religious_society_slavic_pagan_reformed_desc;Their identities marked by hidden axe amulets illustrating their devotion to Perun, underground Slavic curates pray in wild storms, their voices consumed by the thunder.

secret_religious_society_baltic_pagan_reformed;the Children of Dievas;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_baltic_pagan_reformed_desc;As children of Dievas, the hidden followers of the Baltic faith know that everything is connected through the divine spirit, even those who oppress them. So it is that they continue their work unabated, spreading the words of the High Priest even among those who are at first unwilling to listen. Through the divine commonality of Perkunas, Saule or Daugava, they believe anyone can find a home with them.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_tengri_pagan_reformed;the Riders of the Blue Sky;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_tengri_pagan_reformed_desc;No matter how far you travel, and no matter what unbelievers say, you are always under the Heavenly Father, and standing upon the Earth Mother. This is how the followers of Tengri can be so certain in their faith that they follow it even in the face of persecution. All they have to do to prove their faith is to lift their eyes towards Tengri of the Blue Sky above, feel the protection nature provides, and let their Wind Horses ride in prayer to a better place.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_finnish_pagan_reformed;the Speakers of Ukko;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_finnish_pagan_reformed_desc;Even under the rule of another religion, the Suomenusko faith lives strong in some people. Communing with nature, they find their gods in the quiet places of the world. Among the trees, the brooks and the light of the moon, where they worship their divine kings in secret. But silence does not last forever, and it will soon be shattered by the storming in of Ukko on his chariot of thunder, his bolts of lightning striking the faithless to ash.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_west_african_pagan_reformed;the Spirit Keepers;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_west_african_pagan_reformed_desc;As preachers proselytize, there are those who play their part, but in secret turn to the forces around them. No other gods have shown them the small miracles of the world, or the sheer divinity of life and existence. They tell each other stories of how faith does not reside in some otherworldly realm, but in the trees around them, the rocks by their feet, and the waters they drink of.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_zun_pagan_reformed;Zun's Living Fire;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_zun_pagan_reformed_desc;The secret followers of Zun have little need for foreign faiths. The answer to every theological challenge and every moment of doubt is right in the sky above them, every day, without fail. It is what brings life and hope, deserving of every prostration. Just as Zun never fails to bring warmth to the earth and drive the night away, his followers will rise on the other side of their own long night.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_catholic;the Society of Jesus;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_catholic_desc;Ever since its humble roots, Christians have marked themselves by their refusal to abandon their faith in the face of persecution. So it is that a rich tradition of martyrs and underground parishes can give hope to groups of believers in even the darkest of times, no matter what they are outwardly forced to profess. To each other they can profess their true faith in God, and their God is love.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_orthodox;the Old Christians;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_orthodox_desc;Seeing themselves as walking in the footsteps of the Apostles who first built the Church in the name of Christ, there are Christians who will not give up their faith, even when circumstance has forced them to renounce their words. They continue the good work, building their faith and their church, knowing in their hearts that they are doing God's will.;;;;;;;;;;X

secret_religious_society_shiite_desc;The Shiites secretly follow the teachings of the Quran, believed to have been verbally recited to Muhammed by God.

They will stand by what they believe to be the true word of god.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_hindu;Sanatana Dharma;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_hindu_desc;Followers of Hinduism believe it to be The Eternal Way, and even when forced to utter the blessings of another spirit, some know that in the samsara all things will come to pass, and the natural order of things will return. In the cycle of destruction and creation, death and rebirth, endings and beginnings, no other truth will stand victorious for long.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_buddhist;the Eightfold Path;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_buddhist_desc;Those who secretly follow the teachings of Buddha focus on asceticism and distancing themselves of worldly possessions as much as they can without notice. A belief in rebirth into the wheel of life and death makes them distance themselves of all cravings, which bring only pain. There are those who would rather plant a good karmic seed through rebirth than renounce these teachings, as an open profession of faith is not always needed to grow closer to Nirvana.;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_jain;the Harmless;;;;;;;;;;X
secret_religious_society_jain_desc;To conquer all inner passions is to become Jina. The Jains take five vows of self- discipline and asceticism in their search of spiritual development. Ahmisa: to love and cause no harm to other living beings. Satya: to always speak the truth. Asteya: to never take that which is not willingly offered. Brahmacharya: to adopt chastity or celibacy. Aparigraha: the renunciation of worldly possessions. To be Jain is to never break such vows, even when doing so is in itself a secret that tries Satya to its very limits.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_3239_TRAGIC_FAIL;I had just lit the candles when [unfortunate_interrupter.GetTitledName] walked in on us. [unfortunate_interrupter.GetSheHeCap] gasped at the sight of our foreign ceremony, but before [unfortunate_interrupter.GetSheHe] had time to alert the guards, [From.GetFirstName] tackled [unfortunate_interrupter.GetHerHim].

To my surprise, [From.GetFirstName] takes my hand – the faint light of the room reflected only in [From.GetHerHis] eyes, and the holy symbol hanging from a pendant around [From.GetHerHis] neck. "We're supposed to be praying", I mumble and let go, still feeling the warmth of [From.GetHerHis] hand on my skin.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTA_MNM_3262_TT;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! will receive a letter with your advice.\n;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_3264;I was beginning to think that [From.GetTitledFirstName] took offense to my comments, but today I have received a new draft of [From.GetHerHis] work – I am surprised to find that [From.GetHerHis] words really speak to me.

EVTDESC_MNM_6901;I am trying to focus on my training, but [From.GetSheHe] is always there!

EVTOPTA_MNM_6901;It is time to really determine who the superior assassin is.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6901_TT;Challenge §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!. This might have a number of outcomes, depending on whether you win or lose and how [From.GetSheHe] takes it. You might learn a permanent or temporary skill, get injured, gain a new friend or declare a new rival.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6908_A;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not slow to accept my challenge. It was a simple one: we would both craft disguises and enter the nearby town at noon the next day. The first person to spot the other, sneak up on them and place a dagger at their throat would be the winner!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6908_B;[From.GetTitledFirstName] gladly accepted my challenge. We decided to not complicate anything – a duel at midday the following day, a pair of daggers our only weapons. The first person to draw blood would be the winner.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6908;I am ready.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6908_TT;The challenge is about to begin.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun, but this was what my training prepared me for. I kept my eyes peeled and within the hour I spotted another whose gait was incredibly familiar. As I placed the dagger against [From.GetFirstName]'s throat, [From.GetSheHe] laughed heartily. ' A fair victory, [Root.GetSocietyRank].';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_B;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. We had been at it for... hours? I knew I would not last for much longer, and as a last desperate measure, I fearlessly lunged at [From.GetHerHim]. We fell to the ground and I managed to nick [From.GetHerHis] arm. [From.GetFirstName]'s body shook as [From.GetSheHe] laughed underneath me. 'A fair victory, [Root.GetSocietyRank].';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_C;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I did not remember when we had lost our weapons. Now we were wrestling on the ground, neither of us getting enough of an advantage, sweat soaking our clothes and stinging our eyes. 'Draw?' I breathed. 'Alright, draw,' [From.GetFirstName] chuckled in response.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_D;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun. Where was [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I scanned the crowd nervously, but nothing. And then – the coolness of a blade against my throat. 'Impressive disguise, [From.GetSocietyRank]. I mean it,' [From.GetFirstName] chuckled and gave me a hearty pat on the back.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6903_E;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I had to try my very hardest to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay. A droplet of sweat fell into my eye, and as I instinctively raised my hand to wipe it away, [From.GetFirstName] lunged and nicked my arm as we fell. 'Good match, [From.GetSocietyRank],' [From.GetSheHe] chuckled and rolled over on [From.GetHerHis] back.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6903;We should do this again, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_6903;[From.GetFirstName], you... you are marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6904_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun, but this was what my training prepared me for. I kept my eyes peeled and within the hour I spotted another whose gait was incredibly familiar. As I placed the dagger against [From.GetFirstName]'s throat, [From.GetSheHe] cursed my name.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6904_B;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. We had been at it for... hours? I knew I would not last for much longer, and as a last desperate measure, I fearlessly lunged at [From.GetHerHim]. We fell to the ground and I managed to nick [From.GetHerHis] arm. [From.GetFirstName] cursed me loudly as [From.GetSheHe] pushed my body of [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6904;Who is the master now, you [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6904_TT;Punish §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6905_A;I was sweating underneath my heavy robe and veil in the relentless noon sun. Where was [From.GetTitledFirstName]? I scanned the crowd nervously, but nothing. And then – the coolness of a blade against my throat. 'Who laughs now, [Root.GetFirstName]?' [From.GetFirstName] whispered before slashing the dagger across my shoulder.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6905_B;We were evenly matched, [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I. I had to try my very hardest to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay. A droplet of sweat fell into my eye, and as I instinctively raised my hand to wipe it away, [From.GetFirstName] lunged and slashed the blade across my dagger hand with a triumphant shout.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_6905;I will kill that [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6907_A;I could read [From.GetFirstName]'s answer in [From.GetHerHis] eyes as soon as the words had escaped my lips and my heart sank like a stone. It took [From.GetHerHim] a moment to recollect [From.GetHerselfHimself]. 'I am flattered, [From.GetFirstName]. Really, I am. But... I do not feel the same way. I'm sorry. Let us be friends?';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_6907_B;For a moment, the world stood still. I could not breathe. Then the most radiant, heart-warming smile spread across [From.GetFirstName]'s [From.GetFaceDescription] face. 'I thought you would never ask, [Root.GetFirstName].';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_6907;I am honored to be your friend, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_6922_B;I have found out that my superior, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName], has a guilty pleasure.

EVTDESC_MNM_6922_C;A while ago, I noticed the frail nature of my superior, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. People whisper about the [GetRootFromInsult], but no one has dared to draw any attention to the matter. However, for all [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] knows, maybe there is a plot in the workings! I could blackmail [From.GetHerHim] to get what I want.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_10020_A;They are all staring at me, whispering behind my back! As I turn my head towards them, they look away, but I am sure of it. They know. Perhaps not the specifics, but they know. They will come for me, any day now. Being one of [Root.Society.GetName] always felt worth the risk, but I am not so sure anymore...;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_20053;I just learned that my neighbor, [From.GetTitledName], has been stirring up the rabble in [local_province.GetName] with heretical nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_20061;My nights are plagued by terrible nightmares featuring the vile [dw_buddy.GetBestNameWithoutRegnalNumber], my rival [dw_buddy.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.GetDWBrethrenType]. [dw_buddy.GetSubjectPronounCap] howls and roars at me to the tune of infernal bagpipes while [Root.GetDWRandomDemon] looks on, bellowing with laughter. I am sure that [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] is sending me these dreams for a reason... I must prove myself worthy or be discarded as a weakling – such is the way of [Root.Society.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_20061;Invite [dw_buddy.GetFirstName] over for some fun...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_20061;No, dreams are just meaningless nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_TT_20064;My treacherous rival is in for a very nasty surprise!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_20063;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], declined my offer to lay our differences aside and have some harmless fun together. The [GetRootFromInsult] must have sensed my true intentions...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_20063;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_20064;As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] arrived for our meeting, my servants threw a sack over [From.GetObjectPronoun] and beat the [GetRootFromInsult] into submission. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is now snugly stowed into a brazen bull that I had built especially for this occasion. Surrounding the bull are some crucified scum from my dungeon, drenched in oil.\n\nIt took some work to find three genuinely insane musicians, but as they start up their demented tune and the fires are lit underneath the bull, I lean back and realize it was all worth it. As soon as the first bellows start issuing forth from the bull, I order the human candles lit. I close my eyes and hum along with the infernal choir, my nightmares conquered once and for all...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_20064;These are the pleasures that await us all in Hell!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_20065;As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and I were making our way down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] along a darkened trail, someone suddenly threw a sack over me and I was mercilessly pummeled until I lost consciousness. When I came to, I was hogtied and lying on the cold ground. My blindfold was roughly pulled off and I beheld a great brazen bull with firewood stacked underneath! Hooded characters forced me inside, with my mouth near a funnel of some kind. The hatch closed and soon I could hear demented music and chanting as the bull started to heat up. Please, [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], forgive me. Save my soul!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_20065;AAARRGH! AAAAH!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_20067;As [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and I were making our way down to the [Root.GetDWSettlement] along a darkened trail, someone threw a sack over me and knocked me about a bit. Playing along with the charade, I was whisked away and switched for another bundled up victim...\n\nLater, I watched from the shadows as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] staged a demented musical ritual. [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronounCap] had brought an actual brazen bull, just like the one built for the Tyrant of Akragas in ancient times. Believing me to be inside, the [GetRootFromFromInsult] ordered the flames lit. With the bull heating up, oil was poured over a bunch of crucified prisoners and set on fire – human candles screaming in accompaniment to the bellows issuing forth from the bull. The fool never realized [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] was cooking [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] own [GetFromFromVsFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;X

This stone is the Rain Stone... The Yada Tashy. It must be! Rain has followed our every step...'\n\nYou hold the stone in your hand, and ponder the earlier downpour's sudden onset. It makes sense! And with this stone, your lands' crops are all but assured to grow well. Other than the obvious benefit in food production, this should also make you more popular among your subjects.\n\nThe [relic_hunter.GetManWoman] who made it possible smiles at your elation, waiting patiently...;;;;;;;;;;X

'My [Root.GetLordLady], I have searched far and wide, and have found you the bones of Saint Peter, himself!'\n\nOpening the box to sate your curiosity, you indeed find the aged bones and skull of a man, packed in the small space of the container.

EVTDESC_MNM_9811;Followed by one of [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] men, who carefully carries a beautiful harp, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] returns from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] long search. With a broad smile, [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] gives a sign for the man to hand you the instrument.\n\n'What you hold in your hands, my [Root.GetLordLady], is what I have determined to be the actual harp played by King David, himself.' Running your fingers over the strings, the sound is almost divine! To have a talented musician play this instrument would undoubtedly put even the most cantankerous of visitors in a good mood.\n\nYou highly doubt it would work on [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] if you made [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] leave without a reward, though...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9814;Upon [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] return, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] hands me a small jewelry box within which lies a small, engraved, brass and iron signet ring.

'It must be, for it matches all depictions we have of the seal used on Muhammad's letters.' Not only will the Muslim world now surely look up to you, but you can henceforth also claim to write with the authority of Muhammad, himself!\n\nYour [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] waits as you gaze at the seal, clearly expecting a reward...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_9821;The Prophet's Battle Standard;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9821;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] comes before you, proudly carrying a large, inspiring banner.

Holding it in your hands, you feel the connection to the Prophet, and you know that your men will fight like lions wherever it is seen.\n\nAs draw your gaze away from it, you see your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] is still standing there, waiting...;;;;;;;;;;X

The mantle itself is a beautiful buttoned white coat made from goat hair, sure to increase your standing in the Muslim world.\n\nPleased, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] waits for you to speak...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9823;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has returned and brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a beautiful sword. [relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] has proof that it is one of the Prophet Mohammad's nine swords! Not only is it a finely-crafted blade, but it should also make men more eager to follow me in battle.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9824;Returning from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small box within which lies an ancient piece of parchment – a letter addressed to an ancient foreign ruler. Age has not worn the letter past legibility, and so it is possible to clearly identify the signature of the Prophet Mohammad, himself!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9825;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a small glass reliquary. Inside, one can clearly see a single hair, which my [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] claims is a hair from the beard of the Prophet Muhammad, himself!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9826;Upon [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] return, [relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] hands me a richly-decorated flask filled with some kind of liquid.

[relic_hunter.GetSheHeCap] reaches in [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] satchel and produces a beautiful golden cup, which [relic_hunter.GetSheHe] hands to you.\n\n'This can be no other than the Cup of Jamshid from myth,' your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] says, 'drink from it and the truth of this world and all seven heavens will be yours!' The significance of this find sinks in as you hold the cup and listen to your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle]'s words... Properly utilized in a ritual of divination, this cup could indeed, if the legends are to be believed, provide you with the answers to many questions.\n\nAfter a short while you realize [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] is still waiting...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTNAME_MNM_9831;The Babr-e Bayan;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9831;[relic_hunter.GetTitledFirstName] comes before you, proudly carrying a large coat made of leopard-skin. Handing the garment to you reverently, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] explains: 'After a long and arduous search, I have recovered the Babr-e Bayan – Rostam's legendary coat!'\n\nDespite Rostam wearing it in many a war, you find no damage whatsoever on the dark-colored garment as you inspect it. This can only be interpreted as proof of its legendary invulnerability! Donning it yourself would certainly make you much less likely to come to harm in personal combat.\n\nAs you ponder this find's implications, your [relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] is seemingly waiting for a reward...;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_9834;[relic_hunter.GetJobTitle] [relic_hunter.GetFirstName] has finally returned from [relic_hunter.GetHerHis] travels, and has brought with [relic_hunter.GetHerHim] a large, beautiful cypress branch.

EVTOPTA_MNM_9815;No demon shall hold sway over me!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_9815;Alas! It was just a brief interval of lucidity...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_9816;Since I possess the Blessed Mantle, it would certainly be possible to instill a portion of the Mantle's power into drinkable form.

EVTDESC_MNM_1102;In order to properly heat and transform metals or other substances I require furnaces of differing temperature and flames of different types. The alchemical texts speak of various setups that could be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1103;The glass in which I keep my concoctions is brittle and breaks easily. This may be tolerable for beakers and other dispensable glass but earlier today a giant alembic shattered into a thousand pieces after having been heated carelessly by one of my helpers...;;;;;;;;;;X

fancy_laboratory_glass_tooltip;[Root.GetFullName] will from now on spend more to ensure all glass that enter the laboratory is as durable and clear as possible.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1104;Not all pottery is suited for the kind of alchemical work I do. My experiments require both the porous orange pottery that can absorb components in the crucible and the dark and highly fire resistant pots in which even the strongest metal can be melted. Good quality does come at a high price however...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1104;In time locals will rise to this challenge.;;;;;;;;;;X
non_fancy_laboratory_crucibles_tooltip;[Root.GetFullName] will keep the laboratory supplied using the pottery from local potters to avoid the high price of imported crucibles.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1104;Only the best will be good enough!;;;;;;;;;;X

fancy_laboratory_tools_tooltip;[Root.GetFullName] will import alchemical tools from the master smiths that are best skilled to make them.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1106;Sometimes the difference identifying success can be as hard as achieving it. Many metals and other substances are so alike that only an expert can tell them apart. To avoid mishaps perhaps it would be best to invest in a rich library of reference literature to avoid unwelcome surprises.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTD_MNM_1800;On second thought, I don't have time for this.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1810;[gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] and I arrived in the hills early in the morning to collect various useful herbs that we could find in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1810;Our combined knowledge will be useful for identifying the plants.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1810;I at least know how to identify some plants.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_1810;Which were the poisonous ones again?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1812_A;[gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] is most resourceful. While discussing the different aspects of the elements we identify a plethora of plants by tasting and smelling them and the days pass without us even noticing.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1812;We already have more than we can carry.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1812_B;We have now spent days looking high and low for useful herbs. With both me and [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] exhausted we are forced to conclude that the small assortment of interesting plants is what we are getting out of this.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1817_C;As I was nocking an arrow, carefully studying my prey on the other side of the shaft, suddenly [gathering_companion.GetTitledFirstName] starts shouting and screaming.

EVTDESC_MNM_1403;For a while I felt like nothing could extinguish the renewed sense of joy and purpose I gained after drinking the potion. It seems as if I was mistaken.

EVTOPTA_MNM_1403;It was too good to be true...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1416_A;I have been struck by a great loss. The death of [From.GetTitledFirstName] has left me without an apprentice and an assistant, as well as a companion. While I already contemplate taking on a new pupil, I shall surely mourn for [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1420_A;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe letter mentioned three lost texts: a tome in a local antiquary, a scroll hidden in a [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship] in [temple_site.GetName], and a tablet in the ancient library ruins of [ruin_site.GetName] in [ruin_site.Holder.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName].

EVTDESC_MNM_1420_B;To [Root.GetFromThisHermeticsRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have the best of news!

EVTOPTA_MNM_1420_TT;You and §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! set off on an expedition to Alexandria, hoping to find the ruins of the Great Library.\n;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1422;When we found the engraved door to the chamber, we could hardly believe our eyes. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I had nearly given up. That day would be the very last of our search, we had decided, so our discovery must surely have been a divine miracle! My hands were shaking as I, alongside the servants, cleared the last rubble and heaved the door open.\n\nLantern held high over our heads, my colleague and I entered first. The faint light fell on countless pots and chests, elaborate wall paintings and a great forge. Something else reflected the light from deep within the chamber, something vibrantly green... [From.GetFirstName]'s breaths were quick and shallow. 'It.... it cannot be!';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1422;Finally, the deepest secrets of Hermes Trismegistus shall be mine!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1423;Our expedition into foreign lands encountered some difficulties, but in the end we made it to the ruins of [ruin_site.GetName] safely. After a fortnight of excavation the servants uncovered the entrance to a hidden underground chamber. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I entered side by side, the air heavy with excitement.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1424;The bribe we offered the [temple_site.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] of [temple_site.GetName] was enough to make [temple_site.Holder.GetHerHim] unlock the inner chambers of the [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship].

EVTDESC_MNM_1425;[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] and I searched every shelf and chest in the dusty old shop.

EVTOPTA_MNM_1425;I think I found the tome, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_A;My misgivings arose early after our arrival in Alexandria, but [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] insisted that we must have misinterpreted the map. After every failure, [From.GetSheHe] had a new idea. A suspicion crept upon me... What if the map was forged, and [From.GetFirstName] knew? Was the blasted expedition a plot to ruin me?!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1426_B;Our expedition into foreign lands certainly encountered its fair share of difficulties. We dealt with everything from unfavorable weather to lame horses, but in the end, the fraudulent guide was the nail in the coffin.

EVTDESC_MNM_1426_C;The bribe we offered the [temple_site.Holder.Religion.GetPriestTitle] of [temple_site.GetName] was enough to make [temple_site.Holder.GetHerHim] unlock the inner chambers of the [temple_site.Holder.GetHouseOfWorship].

I whisper apologies as we leave, but [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] does not answer.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1437;That recipe never failed me before, I swear...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1438;I had my doubts, but color me impressed! [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] managed to lure the guards away by setting off an alchemical reaction producing the foulest of odors!

EVTOPTA_MNM_1438;I shall steal [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s rarest ingredients and most secret tomes!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1438;My focus will be maximum destruction. Where is the fire steel...?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1439;I have seen many foolish things in my days, but [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName]'s poor attempt at a distraction might just take the prize.

EVTDESC_MNM_1444_A;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! I woke last night as the whole keep shook violently. It seems like someone entered my laboratory and set off an explosion! Luckily, no lives were harmed, but my laboratory is in ruins. There is nothing to save.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_B;If I ever find out who broke into my laboratory, I will kill that vile crook! It seems as if I have made an enemy, for the intruder focused on destruction rather than theft. Acid has been poured on floors and across work surfaces, pots and glass have been shattered and, worst of all, my furnace is filled with the blackened pages of burnt books!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1444_C;I am not sure whether I should be disturbed or amused! This morning, a charred corpse was discovered in my laboratory. Apparently the crook broke in to sabotage my work but managed to kill [From.GetHerselfHimself] in a botched attempt to craft a bomb. I examined the body and the culprit was none other than [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.Society.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1444;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] punishes the sinful.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1446_A;I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] with [From.GetHerHis] hands deep in a big ingredients chest. Our eyes meet and I nod. It is time to go. [From.GetFirstName] stuff a few more vials and nuggets of metal into [From.GetHerHis] satchel before running after me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1446_B;I follow the trail of overturned chests and broken vials until I find [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]. I gesture for [From.GetHerHim] to come with me – it is time to go. [From.GetSheHeCap] stuffs [From.GetHerHis] pockets with a few nearby tools before running after me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1448;As I close my satchel, I hear a loud crash from the other room. As I peek through the doorway, the scene before me is impressive. The warm light of [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName]'s torch illuminates the destruction. Overturned tables, torn books and smashed instruments. I nod appreciatively. 'It is time to leave.';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1448;I wish I could see [infiltration_target.GetFirstName]'s face when [infiltration_target.GetSheHe] realizes what we've done!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1449;As I reach for a nearby tome, a terrifying roar sweeps through the laboratory and the floor shudders underneath my feet. Images of dragons and chimeras flash through my mind before the truth hits me. [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] must have set of an explosion. There is no time look for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1449;No one could have slept through that. I have to run!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1450;Once we have left the laboratory far behind us, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] and I collapse, two bundles of sweaty and shivering limbs. We did it. We really did it, and we got away with it, too! As the laugh erupts from my lips, my body finally relaxes. Next to me, [infiltration_companion.GetFirstName] heavy breathing turns into a merry chuckle.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTB_MNM_1252_2;That certainly takes the pressure off!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1252_TT;You try to put it out of your mind.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_steward;As [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] has been growing older, [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] has been seen expressing [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] sense for organization whenever the opportunity has arisen. I am not even sure where [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] got [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] hands on an abacus, but [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] carries it around wherever [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] goes.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_fighter;Often found near the sparring grounds, [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] is proving surprisingly apt with a spear. Of course the wooden thing is merely a toy, but the faces of my commanders during their practice with [horoscope_child.GetHerHim] hints of a surprising talent in the [horoscope_child.GetBoyGirl].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_diplomat;It does not take anybody long to notice that [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] is a thoughtful [horoscope_child.GetBoyGirl], well attuned to the feelings of others. [horoscope_child.GetSheHeCap] is increasingly curious about foreign customs, and is often found engaging in conversation with servants and visitors alike. "[Root.GetFatherMotherCap]? What is it like to grow up outside of the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]?", [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] asked me today.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_schemer;[horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] has always had a keen eye for intrigue. Reading my letters, eavesdropping on council meetings – the [horoscope_child.GetBoyGirl] has little respect for privacy. Yet it is hard to say what motivates [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] mischief. Meanwhile, the court seems to think that [horoscope_child.GetSheHe] is growing up to be the brightest member of house [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1253_scholar;I know that [horoscope_child.GetTitledFirstName] is well-read for [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] age, but I did not realize the extent of it – the [Root.GetCapitalHolding] archivist recently complained to me: "The young [horoscope_child.GetLordLady] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] made notations in the margin of one the works, [Root.GetMasterMistress]..." Flustered, he continues: "I'd consider it blasphemy, but [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] calculations were also right.";;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1254_steward;As [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] leans over the [inspiring_adult.GetEducationTool], I find myself steering the conversation back to the architecture of our [Root.GetCapitalHolding]. [inspiring_adult.GetSheHeCap] knows of my interests, and I admit it's relaxing to have somebody to talk to about these things. I sometimes wonder whether my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] was right... Am I destined for these matters?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_fighter;I wipe the sweat from my brow as [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] points out the flaws in my parrying technique. I'm glad that a [inspiring_adult.GetEducationRole] like [inspiring_adult.GetHerHim] takes time out of [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] schedule to spar with me, and fighting has in some ways become part of who I am. I sometimes wonder whether my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] was right... Are my battles already written in the stars?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_diplomat;As I am walking around the [Root.GetCapitalHolding], [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] catches up with me. "My [Root.GetLordLady], the council is most pleased with your assessment of their proposal", [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] says, a wide smile on [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] face. [inspiring_adult.GetSheHeCap] has increasingly been encouraging me to partake in diplomatic meetings. "Do you not believe, as your [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother], that it is your destiny, to help people?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_schemer;[inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] has often inspired me to keep my eyes and ears sharp... So when I find [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] notes carelessly strewn around [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] quarters, I cannot help but wonder if [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] intended for me to find them. "From every [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], [Root.GetSheHe] could be the one we will remember... Will the young [Root.GetLordLady] refuse what the heavens have so clearly laid out for [Root.GetHerHim]?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1254_scholar;"Reading has always come naturally to you, child", [inspiring_adult.GetTitledFirstName] tells me, leaning in over my notes. "Your writing is improving as well", [inspiring_adult.GetSheHe] adds, walking back to [inspiring_adult.GetHerHis] seat by the window. The [Root.GetCapitalHolding] is unusually quiet today and outside the sun is shining. Lost in thought, my mind drifts to my [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother]'s horoscope.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1254;Perhaps a [Root.GetHermeticsDestinedRole] is what I am meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1254;Surely [horoscope_maker.GetFatherMother] would want me to make my own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_A;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] remains interested in [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise]. Turning my eyes upwards, I give a silent nod to the heavens, thanking the stars for their guidance.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_B;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] remains interested in [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedExpertise].

EVTDESC_MNM_1255_C;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] is growing reluctant to the idea of becoming a [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedRole]. Sighing, I rub my temples. Perhaps knowing about [horoscope_child.GetHerHis] destiny makes [horoscope_child.GetHerHim] anxious?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1255_D;I am told by the educators that my [horoscope_child.GetDaughterSon] [horoscope_child.GetFirstName] is growing increasingly reluctant to the idea of becoming a [horoscope_child.GetHermeticsDestinedRole].

EVTOPTC_MNM_1466_TT;You force your own idea. Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [Root.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1467;As I look around the table, everyone nods in agreement. 'A fine suggestion, dear [Root.GetSisterBrother],' [great_minds_guest_1.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] exclaims, a wide smile on [great_minds_guest_1.GetHerHis] [great_minds_guest_1.GetFaceDescription] face. 'Tomorrow, we shall begin to work on the project the first thing after sunrise.';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1467_TT;Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [Root.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1468;As I suspected, [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s arguments are thin and flimsy. As we debate, it becomes clear to one and all that [FromFrom.GetHerHis] suggestion was born out of spite and an unfounded sense of self-importance. In the end, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is forced to concede.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1468;Now that this minor interruption has been dealt with... ;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1469;While my idea is clearly better, my arguments seem to fail me. The others do not seem convinced by them, at least. [FromFrom.GetFirstName], on the other hand, proves [FromFrom.GetHerselfHimself] as a true master of manipulation! Within a quarter of an hour, I must admit myself defeated.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1469;We will do it your way, then...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1469_TT;Everyone starts working on the project, which will have a [FromFrom.GetHermeticInvention] focus.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1470;As I enter the laboratory one morning, I am met by agitated voices. [great_minds_guest_1.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] and [great_minds_guest_2.GetSocietyRank] [great_minds_guest_2.GetFirstName] are gesturing wildly over a set of sketches. They are disagreeing on the direction of the project. [great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] argues for a riskier, but potentially more rewarding route, while [great_minds_guest_2.GetFirstName] wants to play it safe.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1470;I agree with [great_minds_guest_2.GetFirstName]. Better to be safe than sorry.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1470_TT;You go with the safe option.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1470;[great_minds_guest_1.GetFirstName] is right. We must explore our limits!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1470_TT;You go with the riskier, but more innovative option.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1471;I am trying to focus on my working, but it is becoming increasingly difficult! [arguer_1.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_1.GetFirstName] and [arguer_2.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_2.GetFirstName] will never agree on anything. If one says one thing, the other must immediately disagree. Sometimes I cannot help but wonder if they are both possessed!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471;Listen to me, friends. Surely, this thing between you is simply a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471_TT;You try to help §Y[arguer_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! and §Y[arguer_2.GetTitledFirstName]§! to make up.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471_SUCCESS_TT;your efforts being successful.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1471_FAIL_TT;your efforts making the problem worse.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1471;Enough! [arguer_1.GetFirstName], pack your coffers and leave!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1471_TT;Decide that §Y[arguer_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! must leave. While the disruptive arguments will be a thing of the past, everyone will remember this failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_1471;This cannot continue! Your presence is no longer desired, [arguer_2.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_1471_TT;Decide that §Y[arguer_2.GetTitledFirstName]§! must leave. While the disruptive arguments will be a thing of the past, everyone will remember this failure.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1472;While my first calm attempts did not make much of a difference, my angry outburst suddenly did. The violent reaction finally brought [arguer_1.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_1.GetFirstName] and [arguer_2.GetSocietyRank] [arguer_2.GetFirstName] to their senses. Now, a few hours later, they approach me to apologize for their petty and lowbrow bickering.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1472;What a relief!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1472_TT;The arguments are over and everyone can continue their work without interruptions.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1473;Calmly, I try to explain the unreasonable nature of their bickering, and how their constant negativity is disruptive to our project. Regrettably, my words seem to have no impact. Actually, I might just have made it worse. 'Do you hear that, [arguer_1.GetFirstName]? You are being disruptive,' [arguer_2.GetFirstName] sneers. And there they go again...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1473;This can never go well...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1473_TT;The arguments between §Y[arguer_1.GetTitledFirstName]§! and §Y[arguer_2.GetTitledFirstName]§! are now worse than ever.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1475;[From.GetFirstName] taps the detail on the sketches in front of us and I nod enthusiastically. 'I agree, [From.GetFirstName]! Surely moving the axis over here would make the mechanism much less prone to error.' During the last few days, [From.GetFirstName] and I have worked so well together. I am so glad [From.GetSheHe] came!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1475;Your input is truly appreciated, [From.GetSisterBrother].;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1476;The sun set hours ago and I can barely distinguish the details of the sketches in front of me. Everyone else has gone to bed, but I am wide awake. The thoughts are spinning in my head, faster and faster. There is something there, just outside of the boundaries of consciousness. I almost have it!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1476;Eureka!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1476_TT;You have an epiphany which will greatly contribute to the project.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_A;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! Our accomplishment is twofold – not only have we perfected the recipe for an explosive powder, we have also designed and produced a device which can launch small metal balls at lethal speeds. This 'handgun' is sure to revolutionize warfare!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1478;The enemy will fear to meet me on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_B;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! We have invented a device which always points towards the lodestar of the north, making it possible to navigate even when the celestial bodies are obscured by clouds. It will surely give an advantage to our traders.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1478;The sun and stars hold many truths, but so does our compass!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_C;The invention, the culmination of our great collaboration, is finally finished! We have designed and constructed an ingenious device to measure angles in the sky. We call it the 'radius astronomicus'. My charts of the stars will become infinitely better and easier to maintain thanks to our invention.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_1478;The secrets of the heavens shall be unveiled!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_D;The hour has finally arrived. Today we test our invention! Together we have devised a huge crossbow which launches large stones. While the weapon is certainly deadly, it is also incredibly intimidating. I will have one mounted on the walls of [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTD_MNM_1478;Only the bravest and the most foolish soldiers would dare crossing its trajectory.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_E;Together my colleagues and I have constructed a huge furnace of a truly ingenious design! It can produce metals in streams so steady and vast that no other method can even hope to rival it. This efficient new invention will make sure we have trading goods and building materials of the highest quality available.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTE_MNM_1478;We are masters of metal, my friends!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_F;The invention is finished! Together we have created our own secret code as well as an instrument to aid in enciphering and deciphering. The idea behind the device might seem simple, but the best one always do. Our cipher disc is quite ingenious, really. Now our secrets will be safe – at least if all of us can be trusted...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTF_MNM_1478;Now we may safely share our ideas and discoveries with each other.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_G;Our invention has been completed. While it is not a weapon, it will offer protection from them. It is a set of armor consisting of several big plates of metal instead of the common mail. The design we have arrived at also allows for impressive mobility.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTG_MNM_1478;Fear will never seep into my heart in battle again!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_H;Many mills dot the landscape around [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName] and are vital for the production of food. It is always a good idea to improve on essential constructions, so during the last we weeks we have made several ingenious improvements to old designs. Our new mill is safer as well as more efficient than ever before!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTH_MNM_1478;Our mill is a true contribution to society.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1478_I;For weeks we struggled to create a lens with new and revolutionary properties, and while we failed to achieve this goal, we came to another realization. What if we took a lens we already had, but changed how we used it, instead? Based on my reading stone, we came up with a new device, the 'spectacles'!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTI_MNM_1478;Now I can bring good eyesight with me wherever I go!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1479_A;We have had several ideas which were clever but impractical, and a heap more which were just ludicrous. The lack of progress has made everyone tired and irritable. Tonight, at dinner, I finally ended it. We all knew it was the right thing to do. Rest was something none of us had known in weeks, and our other obligations had gone unattended for too long.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1479;Maybe we will have better luck next time.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1479_TT;You and your guest fail to invent something useful.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1479_B;We were making such good progress, but now, all is lost! We can never be sure who set of the explosion. Does it really matter? Even if we knew, the disaster could never be undone.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1479;This a dark day. ;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1479_TT;The gathering is over and all progress towards an invention has been lost.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1481;My colleagues have approached me – apparently they have been talking behind my back. They are dissatisfied by the gathering and how it has been managed, and has decided that they will be leaving. 'This venture has no potential, [Root.GetFirstName],' one of them says, in a tone probably meant to be kind. To me, it sounds condescending.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1481;You're not my prisoners. Leave, if that is your wish.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1481_TT;The gathering is over. It ended unsuccessfully.\n;;;;;;;;;;X

One would be hard-pressed to find a more unsympathetic character! I suspect [From.GetSheHe] is spreading lies behind my back to damage my reputation...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_10042;I will confront [From.GetFirstName] and reveal [From.GetHerHis] dishonest ways to the world!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_10042;I must be patient, it will surely pay off in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_10045;I have encountered [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] many times while carrying out my duties for [Root.Society.GetName], and it is always a pleasant occasion. We can talk for hours, if the time allows, because [From.GetSheHe] never bores me. While our discussions are often lengthy, we always seem to agree on the matters which are most important.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_10045;I think this is friendship!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_10045;Or it might be more...;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTD_MNM_1840;I've found a new meaning in my life.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCA_MNM_1841;My [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife] expressed a curious notion, over supper this evening.

Surely, you could take some nights off from your research?";;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCB_MNM_1841;Dining with my [target_spouse.GetHusbandWife], the topic of my research came up again.

"Honestly, I grow weary of defending myself!", I snapped in the end.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1845;While in a meeting with my council, I feel a headache rising inside my skull, making it hard to pick up the different conversations in the room.

EVTDESCA_MNM_1853;The air is crisp and the sky clear, as people huddle around each other to observe the nightly phenomena I have predicted. Not all are convinced of my promise. As the hour begins to slip away, I hear their skeptical mumbling. Then, suddenly, several "Oooh!" and "Aaah!" take place around me, as people excitedly start pointing upwards. Across the dark heavens, a tiny speck of light is moving, a white trail marking its journey.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCB_MNM_1853;The air is crisp, as people gather together at top of the hill, to observe the nightly phenomena I have predicted. Not all are convinced of my promise, and I am beginning to worry. Even if I am right, chances are the star-fall won't be visible tonight, as the weather is particularly cloudy. As the moments pass, one person leaves, and I hear people mumbling. The night grows colder. Eventually, I am left alone on the hill.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1853;This is a night we shall all remember.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1853;I am humiliated!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCA_MNM_1854;The sky is pitch black and clear as I make my way up the hill. Carrying my instruments, I have a good feeling about my calculations – tonight is the night. I begin to unpack, and I am in the middle of adjusting my lenses, when I realize that the star-fall is visible even without my tools. I gasp, my chest filling with jubilant glee. Across the dark heavens, a tiny speck of light is moving, a white trail marking its journey.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCB_MNM_1854;I have been camped out on the hill for hours, hoping against hope. Maybe I missed it? Maybe my instruments are too weak? I wait even longer, but eventually it dawns on me – I was wrong. I am not sure how, but there is no star-fall.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1854;This is what it's all about.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1854;How could I have been so wrong?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1848;I find myself almost buried under an enormous heap of documents occupying my work desk which I have carefully studied. Yet there is still an absence of any observation about the specific light in the sky between two well-known star formations.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1851;On a dark sheet there lies bright dots scattered around, dancing in a random fashion. No matter how long time I spend staring into the sky, no pattern reveals itself for me.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1851;There must be something wrong with my instruments.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1852;[From.GetBestName] has not only discovered a new bright star in the sky, [From.GetSheHe] has decided to give me the honor of having the sparkling star named after myself!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1852;Do I really deserve this honor?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1830;The instruments and tomes that I had to gather for my studies of the secrets behind the stars have finally arrived. Lenses of different shapes and sizes, together with dusty old tomes written by learned people – these will prove invaluable for uncovering the truth.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1830;Now I can carefully observe the sky.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1850;It is rare to have a completely clear night-sky to observe, yet tonight the weather conditions are perfect. I smile, as I begin to carefully note down the pattern of the celestial bodies. I feel a surge of energy – never have I had such a spectacular view of my own constellation, [Root.GetWesternZodiacSign] – I can sense my connection to the elements stronger than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1850;How exhilarating!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_5100;Being at the debate is a draining process. I have not had a good night's sleep since I got here. Either I cannot fall asleep due to a searing pain in the back or I get woken up by loud arguments outside about yesterday's debate topics. Days like these I just long for a warm and cozy bed.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_5100;These accommodations are the worst...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_5100;I can't take this anymore. I want to go home!;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_5101;An opportunity has presented itself for me to level the playing field of the debate. [sabotage_target.GetSocietyRank] [sabotage_target.GetFirstName] a great debater under normal circumstances, [sabotage_target.GetSheHe] is very dependent on [sabotage_target.GetHerHis] meticulous notes.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_5101;Perhaps [sabotage_target.GetSheHe] could find some of mine...;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTA_MNM_5103;An unfortunate accident.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_5103;[From.GetFirstName] clearly did that on purpose!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTTOOLTIP_MNM_5103;Your preparation notes for today are ruined, decreasing your chances of winning the debate.\n;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_5104;I was successful in "accidentally" dropping ink on the notes of [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName], ruining them beyond readability. [From.GetFirstName] was however less than happy with my clumsy behavior...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_5104;You can't make an omelete without breaking a few eggs.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCA_MNM_5015;I performed splendidly in today's debate, much thanks to the brilliant research I found in the hallway. My competitors were left without any good arguments to counter my impeccable logic.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCB_MNM_5015;Reciting the notes I found the other day proved to be an unfortunate mistake... The crowd was loud and vigorous, not because they were struck by my burgeoning intellect, but because they were laughing. Someone must have crafted those notes as a joke!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCC_MNM_5015;During today's debate I recited the notes I found the other day far too literally... After a short while someone in the audience started shouting and called me out on being a fraud for stealing their work.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTTOOLTIPA_MNM_5105;Your performance greatly impressed everyone present, increasing your chances of winning the debate.\n;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTA_MNM_1900;Astrology and the study of the stars.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1900;Alchemy and spiritual transformation.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTC_MNM_1900;Theurgy and the divine.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESCB_MNM_1901;To study alchemy and how to reach spiritual transformation is indeed a learning experience. Albeit more difficult than one might imagine. But time has come to also master the other arts. Which one should be my focus?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESCC_MNM_1901;I have attained great knowledge in the art of Theurgy. Learning about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and divine spirits. Yet, to master the truth and understand it, I will need to learn more about the other arts. Which one should I study next?;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTOPTA_MNM_1905;So much to learn. So little time.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1906;One way to better understand [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is the use of white magic, in which you pray to divine spirits in order to use their guidance. This is known as Theurgy.

'I would like to show you my observatory', [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] said as [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] was turning to lead the way. Once inside, carefully crafted tools and lenses could be seen everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1930;This is truly impressive!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1930;I fail to see the magnificence really.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1931;I showed [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] the way to the observatory. When we stepped inside, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] gazed in wonder at the various tools. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] went on to ask about the different instruments and how to use them. At which times you are more likely to see the stars more clearly. The questions kept coming for quite a while.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1931;I am glad [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] liked it!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1932;I lead [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the observatory and waited for [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] reaction when we stepped inside. At first [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] only looked around. After a while [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] asked a few simple question but I got the feeling that it was not very impressive.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1932;Oh well. We are here to study after all.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1933;[stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] greeted me when I arrived in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName]. After a short conversation [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] lead the way to [stargazing_host.GetHerHis] study. When we stepped inside I immediately noticed all the tools and lenses. It would seem that [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] owns quite a collection of stargazing equipment.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1933;Magnificent tools I must say.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1933;Anyone can acquire such common items, no?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1934;I guided [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the study to showcase my stargazing tools. I could see that [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was delighted as [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] spent quite some time inspecting them. We talked about the tools for quite a while. We even had a long conversation just about lenses. Small lenses and larger lenses, and knowing when to use which ones.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1934;You may use them later tonight.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1935;I arrived at the study with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] closely behind me. 'This is the equipment I have obtained', I explained and gestured towards the neatly ordered collection of tools. [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] inspected the collection for a moment, but did not look very impressed. Or at least as something [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] has seen before.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1935;At least I like them.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1936;Upon my arrival in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName], I was received with great splendor. [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] explained that [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] had chosen a perfect location to use during the night. 'This way and I will show it to you.' [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] lead the way to a hill not too far away. The hill had a decent height for its small size and no trees obscuring the view.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1936;This will suit our needs perfectly!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1936;A lonely hill in the middle of nowhere...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1937;We walked to the hill of my choice not far away. Once there, [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] took a moment to look at the hill and the sky above. 'This hill should suit our needs perfectly I think.' [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] said while nodding approvingly. We quickly decided on where to set up in order to be able to see as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1937;It is all about location, location, location.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1938;I walked with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the nearby hill I had chosen for us. While pointing to a few places that I think would work well for us, I hear [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] complaining behind me. Clearly disapproved of my choice. 'I suppose it will do. But it seems to be very far away if you ask me.';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1938;Trust me. It offers a better view.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1939;When I arrived in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName] I was not only met with a warm smile from [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName], but a grand feast as well! A wide range of courses had been prepared for our pleasure and indulgence. [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] raised a cup in my honor. 'Let us toast for a night of new discoveries!';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1939;A spectacular feast I must say!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1939;Is it not a bit excessive?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1940;When [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] entered the dining hall, I think the feast came as a surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. We dined and enjoyed ourselves and had a good time just speaking with each other for the next few hours. 'You have outdone yourself, [stargazing_host.GetFirstName]. This was spectacular!';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1940;The wonders of good food.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1941;I showed [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to the dining hall and the awaiting feast. The look on [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] face made it abundantly clear that [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was not expecting a proper feast. Perhaps [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] was expecting a small dinner? Did I overdo it?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1941;It tasted good at least.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1942;[stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] was there to welcome me on my arrival in [stargazing_host.Capital.GetName]. Shortly thereafter we made the way to [stargazing_host.GetFirstName]'s private study, where [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] began to show me his current work and most recent discoveries. 'How better to pass the time before nightfall than to spend it on studies and learning?';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1942;That is why I am here.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTB_MNM_1942;Even learning is best in moderation.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1943;Knowing that [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] is a learned man I showed him to my study. After discussing my most recently acquired writings I suggested that we sit down and try to learn something from them. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] responded with approval. 'I would never say no to an opportunity of gathering newfound knowledge. That is after all, the reason I am here.';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1943;Knowledge is power.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1944;Thinking that [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] would jump at the chance of examining my most recently acquired writings, I showed [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim] my collection. After a moment of glancing through the pages, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] casually put the writings back in their place. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] then suggested that we rest before the night.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1944;I presume the journey was long?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1945;Night is almost upon us and the first stars are finally making themselves visible on the sky outside. I should tell [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] that it is time. Time to see if we can uncover new secrets.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1945;We should get ready.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1947;[stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and me have been looking at the stars for a few hours already. Suddenly, it occurred to me. Stars are aligned in different patterns, taking on the shapes of different figures. But they are not really moving, are they? They always seem to have the same location in relation to one another.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1947;[stargazing_guest.GetFirstName]! Take notes!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1948;I was reading through our notes when [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly shouted at me. '[stargazing_guest.GetFirstName]! It just occurred to me!' [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] then went on explaining [stargazing_host.GetHerHis] theory about how the stars never move and how they are related to one another.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1948;[stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] could be on to something!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1950;I was writing down some notes when I heard [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] speak behind me and turned to face [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim]. [stargazing_guest.GetSheHeCap] then went on to explain a theory of how the zodiacs are connected with each other how they are aligned in a certain way.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1950;Yes. Interesting thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1951;When looking at the stars and the patterns they create on the sky, I started thinking on the zodiacs. I quickly explained my newfound theory to [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] who nodded in agreement. The zodiacs are sure to be hiding secrets waiting to be unveiled.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1951;I am certain of it!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1953;After several hours of studying the stars, I saw it. A sphere moving slowly across the sky with a long tail behind it. I called for [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] to get [stargazing_guest.GetHerHis] attention. We both marveled at the beauty of it for a while. 'It is clearly something divine about it.' [stargazing_guest.GetFirstName] said after a moment of silence. I could only nod my head in agreement.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1953;It makes us seem so small.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1954;After several hours of studying the stars, we noticed a sphere moving slowly across the sky with a long tail behind it. Both me and [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] marveled at the beauty of it. 'It is clearly something divine about it.' [stargazing_host.GetFirstName] nodded slowly in response. 'It is. But it is hardly an omen of the end times like the peasants would make you believe.';;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1954;No it is not. But it is beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1955;[stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] and I have been taking turns in making observations and recording everything. I cannot say that we have made any significant discoveries so far. We have made some progress, however, and learned a few things we did not know before.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1955;The night is not over yet.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1957;We have spent hours observing the stars and trying to look for anything out of the ordinary. Neither [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] nor I has made any noticeable progress so far. With most of the night gone already, it is unlikely that we will accomplish much more.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1957;What a disappointing night.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1958;We have spent hours observing the stars and trying to look for anything out of the ordinary. But neither of us has been able to make any significant progress. Which is disappointing, to say the least. But I can see that my host, [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName], is more disappointed than I am. [stargazing_host.GetSheHeCap] probably had very high hopes for the night.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1958;So did I.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1959;The sky was filled with ominously dark clouds already when we started our observations. As the hours drags on, it is only getting worse. You cannot see anything by now! Not a single star in sight! I suppose we might as well call it a night right here...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1959;Curse this weather!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1962;After spending to night together with [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName], I feel like we have become quite close. We seem to complement each other perfectly and the both of us are having a really good time!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1962;I have gained a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1963;Accepting the invitation to come here and spend the night studying with [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] was the correct decision. I have not had this much fun talking to someone in quite a while. We seem to understand each other perfectly!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1963;Thank you my friend.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1965;This night seem to never end. I am wondering why I even invited [stargazing_guest.GetTitledFirstName] in the first place. Nothing I have done so far seem to please [stargazing_guest.GetHerHim]. Whenever I try to start a conversation to lighten the mood, [stargazing_guest.GetSheHe] only answer with an obnoxious remark.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1965;I cannot wait for you to leave...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1966;I should just have thrown away [stargazing_host.GetTitledFirstName] invitation the moment it arrived. This night has been nothing short of horrible. Listening to [stargazing_host.GetHerHim] hurling one insult after the other. One might be thinking if that is the reason why [stargazing_host.GetSheHe] invited me here!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1966;I have never been so offended!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_A;Dawn is upon us as the first light appears on the horizon. I think we can agree that the night was an immense success. We took plenty of notes and learned a thing or two. Maybe we will have an opportunity to continue our combined research in the future?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_B;An exhausting night finally ends. We worked throughout the entire night without any sort of noticeable progress at all. While it feels disappointing, I am confident that continued observations will yield superior results.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTDESC_MNM_1968_C;Time really do fly when you are having fun. We did not make any sort of noticeable progress in our attempted research. But the night was spent in good company, making it feel much less of a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_A;Let us do this again sometime.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_B;Progress takes time.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1968_C;Progress or not. I had a great time!;;;;;;;;;;X
EVTOPTA_MNM_1969;Time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVTDESC_MNM_1981;A courier just arrived carrying a letter from [FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. Reading the letter, I see that it is an invitation bidding all members of [FromFrom.Society.GetName] to attend the Grand Debate.;;;;;;;;;;X

[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName] has provided you all with a new, special type of incense that [From.GetSheHe] claims is necessary to make the eventual connection with the Divine Being. Before long it has permeated the air, and as you inhale more and more of it, hearing the drone of your fellows' chants, you feel your soul disconnect from your body and begin to ascend...\n\n...until it seems to connect with something. An... entity touches your soul, though you cannot perceive it with any senses other than your mind's eye. It must be the Divine Being! You have succeeded!
